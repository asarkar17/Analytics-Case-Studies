47	I kept getting disconnected...after about 12 attempts I finally got connected and stayed online :) I am now happy. when trying to get online...I'm cut off as soon as I get connected..when going to look for web sites...I get disconnected.  I pay for a monthly service that I don't get

318	getting booted
319	Fast and easy.
320	I have been online for about 4 yrs or so!!   I just like being online and gettin my email  looking up things on the web and etc BUT ABCD is really too expensive compared to other ISP  but its the only one i can get using my checking account  I dont have a credit card.  I tried to get ABCD acount for 14.95 ABCD offered Target employees BUT  i would have to dump my email address for a new account only I was not happy so i just continued with my old account....   
321	ABCD gives me everything I want to know virtually on my screen, from current events, sports and is constantly updating screen with latest breaking news and events

325	cost. easy 
326	The service was available and I was able to retrieve my email.
327	checked my email
328	Got on and did what I had to do with ease.
329	I really don't have a problem with ABCD.  Ther only problem that we had was that someone got my husbands information, and the price could be alittle better.  I like ABCD and would not go to anyone else.  ABCD is ease to use and friendly, it has what I need and llike it.
330	ABCD is the one constant upon which I can truly rely.
331	I am able to get on quickly and take care of my business and move on to other things then come back.
332	Because there wasnt opinion polls available when I needed one.  My email box was flooded with trash email.  I want to block them out but not block out people other than friends.
333	I had no trouble checking my email.
334	i called one night about a problem and had the rudest person on the other end,,,,, like i bothered her. just had a good day on ABCD without being booted off 
335	just able to get on 
336	Easy to use, I use it everyday.
337	It is too expensive.
338	i love ao its so easy to use
339	I didn't get disconnected. My free year subscription is up
340	I found what I was looking for.
341	t get my mail & news
342	signed on fast ! 
343	Because I didn't get booted
344	it's too expensive for what you get.
345	just was
346	Got to most items I wanted. had problems with others.
347	Ease of use. Monthly membership is too expensive.
348	I just was. I'm now using a modem cable.
349	No tecnical problems and am going use to pop ups even though I do not like them nor want them. 
350	I was able to maneuver without any problems
351	dont know.price is to high can get better prices
352	I went on to check a hotel and the site gave me a # to call to make res. and once a call and they took all my info including my credit card # they said they couldnt make the reservations. Gave me another # to call and it wasnt any good.
353	I feel comfortable moving around using my ABCD service.  
354	got the info I needed
355	I was able to obtain the information I was inquiring about.
356	1)  When people send me e-mail with attachments I can't open them or view pictures.  I have made several adjustments per ABCD personnel but none have made a difference.  This has been a problem since I joined ABCD.  2)  The system automatically erases my e-mails that I have viewed after a certain amount of time.  As far as I am concerened, it is my account and I should be the one deleting them.  3)  When I save an e-mail to my saved file, I can't access it.  I have gone into the help area but it does not tell me how to access the ones that I have saved.. was able to access everything that I have set up in my favorites without being booted off the system AGAIN.
357	Had no problems connecting to  any sites. Web site surfing very helpful.
358	There were no stalled times in bringing up informtion.  This happens from time to time, but not very often.  I usually just turn off my computer.
359	Ease and convenience. I used ABCD Anywhere. I was able to access my email account from a computer that doesn't have ABCD as it's server.
360	I am tired of getting kicked off of line, and I pay for a modem also.
361	I get bumped off all the time.
362	I checked mail from work... not an ABCD server there.
363	I didn't get cut off afeter signing in. I just got on to read my mail. I have two sons in the service and it is very important to me to have that access without getting cut off..
364	because I was in a hurry and I could get on and check my e-mails and check on  other things and get off
365	TOO MANY TIMES BEING KNOCKED OFF LINE cost too much 
366	no knock offs 
367	Terrible customer and Tech service  an dun able for a tech to resolve the issue a continous
368	Unable to solve the issue 
369	I always get kicked off.
370	I keep getting kicked off if I even get online at all.
371	It didn't crash.
372	i hate the pop ups 
373	I had no issues, except alot of junk mail everytime I get on
374	was not booted off
375	"I liked the news info and pictures available...liked being able to ""favorite place"" the sites I was interested in."

389	I was able to get right on and use the internet without any delays.
390	ABCD requires us to be a member, to be able to play on the EA/WP Bridge Site. This site is on the edge of closing down, and the problems are getting worse, no connection, booting, etc. If this site goes, so do I.
391	usually when u ask for tech help, u get a tech that makes u wait and knows little about the problem at hand. Their textbook greetings and apologies, seem fake and are annoying. Today, I got someone that spoke to me like I was a real person, she was informative and helpful and she followed up like she said she would. This is a novelty for the Techs at ABCD.
392	because of the customized ABCD startup screen, I was able to go exactly where I wanted with virtually no effort, and because the news is always kept up to date, so I don't have to wait for my local paper to get the current headlines and information I want to know about. 
393	ease of navigation
394	quick access
395	the prce is too high and i am getting a lot of ads poping up

409	I didn't get shut down or have any problems.

423	Because what I needed answered was taking care of.
424	Basically no problems during use
425	The site seems to be working well, etc.
426	Because it would not load I had to log off and try to log again.  I don't know if it was my computer or if it is ABCD.
427	I was able to find information quickly and effortlessly.
428	Mission accomplished in sending  and receiving e-mail. Great Service. Have used ABCD for years.
429	cust service ppl and most all ABCD family always helpful, have suggestions to help you, u need not take suggestion, but they offer if needed.  very professional, curteous, always a pleasure to deal with them. to bad i have to leave ABCD for monitarily reason. But i cant help. it is unavoidable
430	i like the hi speed. However it is the hi price.  
431	It was a very effeortless in and out not a long time to get in.  Very easy to get around, they make everything clear on how to get were you want to be.
432	I was able to do everything that I wanted to get done easily without much hastle.  I also got to talk to a friend I don't see very often but was online at the same time as I was.

447	financial reasons
448	I waited on the phone for over 20 minutes to talk to someone. I have another service
449	I was trying to cancel service online and it doesn't seem possible. That is stupid! People can set it up online but can't cancel. 
450	Price compared to other services/combined with difficulty in speaking to COMPETENT service people.
451	I was satisfied because is easy to use 
452	cost , go with a cheaper company 
453	no porn instant messages
454	ABCD is very easy to use and would be the best if it was just a little cheaper.
455	Easy to get on to. 
456	very easy to use
457	easy to use services
458	Connected quickly, found what I was looking for.

474	because, as usual, I had no problems.
475	Everything went smoothly.
476	I like the ease of ABCD and I never have problems with finding the information I need.

478	everything seemed to work with little or no lag time in accessing the internet.
479	I did what I wanted to do
480	Easy to find what I was looking for, and fast
481	everything went fine
482	"Found what I was looking for; proprietary content well organized"
483	 BECAUSE I WASN'T CUT OFF. THINGS WERE QUICKER TO GET TO. SOMETIMES IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET TO WHAT I WANT. WHEN GETTING ON LINE THE PHONE LINE WASN'T BUSY.
484	Because I was able to connect without a problem
485	was faster than normal
486	See last input.
487	The more it's updated, the clunkier it gets. It's obviously geared for 14 year olds. Lots of glitz, but no real substance. I can get the web-browser I need for half the price.
488	ease of use
489	ease of service
490	Didn't get dropped.
491	It seems to take forever for ABCD to initilze,start, and run and then it seems to occasionally lock up my computer so I have to go through all this again.
492	You have too many pop up windows--it takes forever to initialize, start, and run ABCD.  My computer locks up frequently when I use ABCD.
493	I am always satisified with my visits . I have used other services and ABCD is much better than any other ones. I perfer it to any of them. I have used 4 different oned and would much rather use ABCD
494	Was able to check my mail and other without much wait.  
495	checked my e=mail
496	could not get on line - 
497	Had to delete about 30 useless emails after only 2 days.  I had reported them as spam for about a month but the volume of junk keeps increasing.
498	cost
499	No complance
500	"I got ""partial"" information."
501	I was finally able to fully download something without the service interrupted. 
502	The price is too high.
503	Because i got on quick did what i needed to do and then got off quick
504	Currently not employed.
505	I had no problems getting to the sites I wanted.
506	Easy to find what I'm looking for. 
507	I got every thing done that I wanted to.
508	Ease of acquiring and opening  email.
509	allows you to log on quickly
510	because of the price there seems to be better prices out there
511	Operations went smoothly, without hastle
512	got bumped off right after login
513	to many pop ups and I keep getting disconected
514	I GET TO VISIT THE SITES THAT I WANTED AND CHECK MY EMAILS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS
515	GOT TO WHERE I WANTED TO GO WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS
516	there were no problems
517	I go into a chat room and people repeatedly come in to be mean.  We tos these individuals and yet they come back the very next night to do the same thing.  Yes, we can ignore them but it makes our chat experience not very pleasant.  There is one member that punts people in the chat room, makes threats, etc. and nothing ever happens to her.
518	1/2 the people on ABCD cant speak english.if i cant understand them,they cant understand me. ABCD should make sure all repesentives can speak english
519	cable modem compared to phone modem speed
520	I am moving in the next few months so I will cancel my ABCD until I set up my computer system at my new home. At this point I will decide which interent service to use based on price and overall quality.

527	yes, of course I was satisfied with my last visit with ABCD
528	i like to surf ...but i wish there was a way to do it faster 
529	i accomplished what i needed. too many pop ups and way too much spam
530	Didn't get knocked off line.
531	buffaloroam.net

542	I was able to sign on without difficulty and my connection was not interrupted.  
543	Financial reasons
544	I got answers to my specific question
545	gets bootedtoo much , bad for hackers slow getting online
546	Accomplished what i needed to do.
547	no pop up porn appeared while I was working on documents or when I checked my mail...however there appears to be NO way to bar httl graphics in ABCD email...at least ABCD Help had no answer when I contacted them.

553	I got all my mail and was able to read up on current events.
554	Logged on/off with ease.
555	I really enjoy ABCD 2.3.  I love the new features.  I've always been a fan of ABCD.  Other ISP's just don't compare.
556	Few problems while online.  Buddy list problems when viewing a profile.
557	being kicked off at least every 3 to 5 minutes--changed access #'s several times and have followed the advice of tech. support
558	Everything worked quick enough
559	Because i got every thing done that was planed to do.
560	It takes a while to get online, and says it has to close alot and there are alot of technical problems. 
561	I was given several different ways to solve the problem.
562	i had no problems navagating on the site.

576	It came on quickly and I was able to get to my destnations with no problems.
577	I was able to read my mail.
578	cuz I didn't get knocked off...  like I have in the past...
579	EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I HAD ACCESS TO EVERYTHING I WANTED AND EASE OF USE.
580	i LOGGED ON RIGHT AWAY. SOMETIMES I HAVE TO KEEP ON TRYING BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS BUZY
581	I was sending a e-mail and got knocked off.
582	Takes forever to connect,always getting knocked off
583	pop ups, being booted off line, room size, children in adult chat room, people working for ABCD that send other viruses and have them tossed for no reason
584	Because the tutorial to have a second sign on made it very easy
585	did not get loose connection this time
586	information was still available from previos visit
587	no longer needed on a day to day basix.  Too expensive

609	because i did not have any problems to visit the web that i wanted to go
610	was easy 
611	gives ne easy access to my needs.
612	High speed internet not available in our area.
613	Just on long enough to check e-mail.

616	cost

619	no major problems
620	Payment method and a cheaper plan
621	got booted 3 times the most since i got my new computer.

632	ease of getting on line

636	none..i won't canel unless you go out of business or increase rates.
637	quick e-mail check
638	just a good job
639	Quick connections
640	cost and service
641	price
642	there was only one pop-up 
643	it is too expensive
644	no special reason
645	I know I can depend that the site will be available and get me to the games I like to play.  Easy to maneuver thru the site for the information I want/need.
646	I didnt get cut off
647	too slow lately, keeps cutting me off, too long to connect
648	found what I was looking for
649	Apparently ABCD enlarged the ability to block unwanted email addresses.
650	no problems
651	It took me three or four trys to get connected.
652	Poor to lousy tech support for Macintosh computers. The times I have used tech support the information given was either out of date or incorrect. The last incident required me to completely wipe my system clean and reload all the software to enable my system to work again...the ABCD tech support given directed me to delete ceratin files that ended up corrupting other browsers I use
653	I had a good visit with two of my brothers.  They were able to IM to me, but I am having trouble figuring out how to IM to them.  Neither of them is on ABCD and I don't know how to install that ability on my computer.
654	I was able to read my email
655	Less expensive service with another provider
656	When I try to send an email it takes minutes with the hourglass sitting there and the ABCD icon spinning around.  After waiting minutes for the hourglass to go away sometimes I press Esc and Send Later. Then when I look in my Online Sent Mail I see that the email was sent.   But I did not get the popup box informing me that my email was sent, and it does not appear in my PFC.  I have had several emails back and forth with Customer Care Consultant TechMail Department and the problem has not been solved. I am quite frustrated.  
657	kept freezing up
658	ABCD adds costs to its monthly service and I can get the same service with another ISP.

661	got on fairly easy without disconnection
662	I DIDN'T GET BOOTED OFF
663	the problem was solved
664	No problems with dial up as I had experienced in the past.
665	price
666	Did not take long to get what I needed
667	I ad a questin abut billing and they made it alot clearer as to what the billing detail mant
668	because i am knowing that my kids are safe online.
669	BECAUSE I FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
670	PAYING VERSUS FREE
671	I accomplished everything that I needed to in a relatively short period of time.
672	I feel that ABCD is always prompt with my emails...
673	There is always up to date news that I view on a regular basis, and can view it with ease.  
674	COST AND SERVICE
675	HAD NO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS
676	Found what I was looking for.

682	i guess so
683	I got connected ok, and did what I needed to do with no problems.
684	i had no problems
685	I was able to talk to someone online about my billing problem and she helped
686	If I would, it would be because of the problem with the credit card information.  Hopefully, this problem is fixed, but I do not like giving this information on line.
687	to expensive compared to other services that do the same.
688	Only one minor problem, but that may have been American's website.
689	Because I easily found the information I was looking for.
690	Because I know that ABCD is safe and if my daughter gets online on ABCD I know that ABCD has great controls for kids under 18
691	I am able too sign on easily and quite fast, check my mail, block unwanted spam, see which buddies are signed on, check my tax refund status, make bank transfers and play online games like slingo for free........allin a matter of 30 mins!
692	buddy list, email
693	trying 2.3
694	I got the information i needed.
695	price

701	"FAST & SOLVED MY PROBLEM ; ABOUT USING KEYWORD: ""PARTNER PROMOTION"". "
702	was able to perform mail, message boards and browse internet with no interuptions. 
703	Relatively quick access, easy to find what I needed, up-to-date news reports
704	Can't really think of a specific reason...haven't used any other service to compare to.

715	I do not intend to cancel my membership
716	It was quick
717	I got on without line being busy, etc. 
718	Sometimes it is hard to access.  Also I do not like the ABCD pop ups on broadband,etc. Plus other carriers are less expensive.
719	I would have to say because of the ease of use.
720	Found everything I was looking for.
721	Igot lots of good e-mail
722	Junk mail
723	Taking the time to delete unwanted mail
724	IT COST TOO MUCH MONEY!!
725	cost to much.
726	friendly and helpful
727	didn,t have any trouble
728	Because i got to chat with friends and look at websites with no problems.
729	customer service and courtesy to your customers does not exist
730	if a called different times with the same question i would get different amwsers
731	"All of the sites I visited were responding, and did not have other unrelated ""pop up's"" interfering with the sites I needed to see."
732	I don't feel ABCD Customer Service is trained well enough on the issues of crediting accounts to make the customer want to stay with ABCD.  Example:, I called to cancel my account because it was to expensive right now..I was given 2-months fress which was wonderful. However, no one explained that the current month's deduction would still come out of my checking account.  This caused a terrible financial mishap on my behalf because that one thing was never explained to me.  When I contacted customer service no one wanted to help.
733	long time to connect to sites.  Popup ads are appearing more frequently than ever, and that seems to have started a few weeks ago.
734	Because of the your billing policy, the excessive advertisiements, and pop up screens.
735	everything worked   i did not get knocked off line like i always do.  only one phone # for my area.
736	Quick and easy to find what I want
737	everything went fast, i did not have any pop-ups. i could get to my game i wanted to play easy.
738	downloads were fast
739	The ease with which I was able to get on line
740	I like that I can check my email, read up on current events, check the weather, and talk to my friends through instant messanger all in one simple effort. 
741	I WAS ABLE TO PLAY THE POGO GAMES.
742	I always am satisfied
743	ease of use
744	I was able to obtain the information I  needed
745	Able tolocate information on website concerning health questions.
746	Checking email was easy
747	i was able to access the web sites i wanted to.

815	Monthly charge is too high.
816	Very fast and informative.
817	I get kicked off all the time for no reason.  ABCD freezes up and I have to close out of ABCD to get it started again and then it just does the same things over again.  I am not paying this much for online service to be kicked off 10-15 times a day or to have it freeze up EVERYTIME I sign on.
818	It froze up and I had to close out of ABCD.  Plus it froze at least 10 times while I was online for 30 minutes.

820	I was able to get online on the first try without having to retry.

826	I had no problems--I checked my mail and found every website I was looking for.
827	Didn't have any trouble getting in. The news was up to date. A lot of options were presented. There window on Spam was very easy to open and understand.

830	i did what i had to do without being booted 
831	It was a good experience
832	I dont have any trouble signing on
833	i didn't  get booted off 
834	Too many pop ups while I was trying to look up information quickly as I am out of free minutes.  The pop ups where time consuming and annoying.

849	because everytime we go on line we get kicked off, or your in the middle of doing something and your kicked off and the best is trying to get on and it take you 10 to 20 mintues to get on.  I am looking into another service.
850	got kicked off during a group on line talk with the family
851	I seemed to be able to get the information that I requested
852	easy to use
853	money money money
854	Ease of use.
855	 easy access to favorite sites
856	i just wanted to check my email and ABCD is very conveniant for checking email
857	I got on line right away and got what i needed
858	i only used it to read my email, didnt do much else.
859	was able to do alot in a few minutes, check the weather, etc,
860	"Because it was easy to do my e-mail and the ABCD ""top ten photos"" had a great picture of a wreck in the Daytona 500."
861	didn't get kicked off line
862	It is easy to use, there are a lot of options, and it is a convenient way for me to do research for school and talk my friends and faily
863	I was able to get online, check my mail, read the headlines, and play a game.  I pop in and out through out the day. 
864	I use dial-up currently and lost my connection.
865	Less spam mail then usual! No problems with ABCD at all
866	I do enjoy being on ABCD because I can get around quickly to sites and not have all the pop ups coming at me.
867	Just got all of the information that I needed to inquire.
868	I get on check the news and my emails 
869	ABCD WAS RUNNING VERY SLOWLY.. HAD HARD TIME IN THE CHAT ROOM AND OPENING EMAIL AND THE SAME TIME.. MY BUDDY LIST TOOK 30 MINS TO POP UP.. I ALSO COULDNT RECEIVE IMS AT THAT TIME..
870	quickly reached the websites I wanted to reach
871	I HAD WHA i WAS LOOKING FOR.
872	No reason.  Just browsing.
873	everything worked the way it should
874	information requested found promptly 
875	I GOT ON EMAILED AND GOT OFF QUICK AND THEN BACK ON AGAIN WITH NO INTERUPTIONS.  i USE THE MAILBOX OF EMAIL ADRESSES ALOT.  ITS A LIFESAVER.
876	I was able to find a keyword i was looking for
877	I accomplished all of my objectives.
878	"I had a problem with my billing; and the problem was corrected"
879	i WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT MY MAIL WITH NO PROBLEM
880	Easy to use, knew who was on when i signed on, and the abitlity to personalize my ABCD screens
881	no problems
882	I may move
883	i was able to find what i was looking for rather easily
884	I just enjoy ABCD 
885	BECAUSE IT GIVES ME INFORMATION THAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND IT IS REALLY MY FAVORITE INTERNET SERVICE.
886	I hate pop-ups!  
887	met needs
888	I got online right away and was able to find everything I needed quickly.
889	ABCD is easy to use.Wonderful personnel.
890	It's just too expensive.
891	it was not slow today
892	Just checked my email, and there were no problems.
893	Read me email, checked latest news headlines
894	Cost of the service.  I have cable connection now and ABCD is still relatively slow and expensive compared to other providers.
895	I was able to do what I went online to do and I connected easily.
896	My computer is old, and I need a new one.  I cannot download 2.3 because my computer cannot handle it.
897	No problems.  Everything worked fine.
898	1) cost  2) not enough filtering
899	ease getting 0on
900	I was knocked off line 3 times in less than 2 minutes!
901	i was at work and did not know if i would have time to get on at home.  like the ability to check mail at my job or at a friend's.
902	user friendly
903	no problems
904	Finally got through to ABCD.Sometimes it's a long wait- very frustating.
905	Easy to sign on and quick connection
906	easy to navigate
907	I had not problems with ABCD
908	if i can get the price down
909	Because I found a topic I was looking for and it wa very informative.
910	found what i needed to find
911	It was the same as it always is.
912	easy to navigate
913	I found the sites I was looking for.
914	Everything seems to be working
915	Price
916	ABCD does not provid cable modem service.  And now I'm paying for two services.
917	After much ado, I did, finally,get an answer to my question.
918	I just got on to check my e-mail and didn't have any problems.
919	sending e-mail and checking some web sides is very fast and easy
920	i had no problems visiting the sites i wanted to.
921	Service was slower than normal.  SPAMS popped up.  Too many ads.  Computer froze up. 
922	I found what I was looking for.
923	everything went as planned, no problems
924	i had no problems logging on
925	The connection was relatively quick, and everything ran smoothly.
926	It was fast and easy
927	EVERYTHING WORKED.  i HAVE HAD TROUBLE GETING CONNECTED AND STAYING CONNECTED
928	just seems to get easier each time I use ABCD   understanding more
929	i diden't get kicked off
930	bad serivce
931	didn't get disconnected, everything basically went smooth
932	"got kicked off,and having problems with ""website not responding"""
933	NO FREEZE UPS OR PROBLEMS.
934	I either can not get online or they lose the cnnection while I'm online.
935	its easy to use and having random IM's from other members is always fun.
936	no problems
937	I am always satisfied with ABCD.  Its my excape from my house. Its a different world.  LOL
938	Too much time to sign on & off
939	It wasn't any different than the time before
940	i got on with no problem
941	I wae able to complete my work in a reasonable amount of time.
942	I didn't get any pop-ups or junk e-mail on my ABCD e-mail account.
943	Price is too high compared to competitors.
944	Switching to cable, although may keep ABCD, has yet to be determined.
945	i got what i needed
946	ABCD has a hard time figuring out my billing problems and changes,
947	it is fast
948	no reason to be dis satisfied
949	I just got on to read my E-mail and got off it was a quick visit.
950	The main reason I would cancel ABCD is the monthly price, I would like to find something cheaper
951	user friendly
952	I enjoy ABCD ... I don't know what more I can say. I haven't changed yet cause ABCD have spoiled me :o)
953	Price.
954	Didnt get booted and I wasnt froze up.
955	I am tired of the freeze ups and not being able to even sign on at times.
956	yes-i had very good exp. with on line customer service rep.solved my technical question.
957	got to what i needed quickly
958	the connection was slow and I can never get the web pages i need to get to. AND I AM SICK OF ABCD SENDING ME THERE OWN POP UPS
959	the connections are not great the service is slow and it is more than twice as much as others for not much more. I would rather not have a few little things that i don't use anyway and save my money
960	computer very slow 
961	everything went smoothly.
962	Easy to connect to the service. Easy to understand and use. 
963	I had no problem except with popups 
964	easy on, and good e-mail and picture capabilities
965	yes i was very satisfied-david who i spoke with couldn't of been nicer
966	found what I was looking for
967	I had a good connection speed
968	playing cards on pogo
969	Connected the first time.
970	Good experience.
971	WENT VERY SMOOTHLY
972	Pop-ups
973	Too many pop-ups, lack of concern on ABCD
974	moving away
975	ABCD is easy to use and provides me more than adequately with what I need....so my last visit was good.
976	Cause A: ABCD didn't kick me off as it has done in the past and as it does to my friends....B: I didn't have too much Junk mail to delete C: My friends were online
977	It took me where I wanted to go without difficulty.
978	DID NOT GET DROPPED OFF LINE
979	   I only got knocked off for illigal action once for now reason at all.  Last couple of weeks I get booted at least 3 or 4 times every day     Hasnt worked right since upgradin to 2.3.  and I am only using 2.0 but its sooooooo much slower.  
980	it was OK
981	I had an email from my baby.
982	to much ads
983	quick connect,visited sites i wanted to.
984	BECASE THEY GAVE ME ALL MY E-MAIL WITHOUT THEM LOKING OR GOING THROUGHT IT.
985	fast log on
986	fastest connection
987	found what I was looking for
988	speed, 
989	stock market report is up to date
990	Nothing went wrong
991	Beginning to understand that spam is more than an ABCD issue
992	Too much spam everyday regardless of the filters used
993	i am a full time student and can't afford extras right now until i get out of school
994	no screen freezes no pop ups and got around quickly
995	easy to access and not alot of pop-ups
996	to many pop ups and sometimes it is hard to get on the games...
997	get on fast and no trouble. it likes to kick you off sometimes
998	i WAS ABLE TO FIX MY COMPUTER.
999	ABCD is very easy to navigate.  That's one of the reasons why I still have this service. 
1000	i was somewhat satisfied takes to long to connect
1001	because of my email 
1002	I checked the weather conditions and and ABCD is quick and easy to use.
1003	price
1004	Access is easy and user friendly
1005	no junk email
1006	Had no problems and got to do what I planned to do.
1007	unbale to contact ABCD service, ABCD service once contacted promise to send info but never do
1008	Everything worked no hang-ups and/or stalls,connection was good
1009	I was able to get on with no problems
1010	Able to check email with little problems, except for the increase in spam over the past few months.
1011	the technition  was very helpful in assisting me in installing the 2.3  as the cd did not work.  they are always helpful.
1012	Service as expected. I would hope it is as good everytime I visit
1013	Cause it did everything I wanted it to.
1014	I was seting up a new pc . It was fast and easy .
1015	u/k
1016	ABCD didn't crash
1017	EVERYTHING IS SO SIMPLE WITH ABCD
1018	it would have to be because of poor service
1019	time it takes 
1020	i found what I was looking for
1021	Because I'm ALWAYS dissatisfied with ABCD.
1022	FOUND ALL INFO I WAS LOOKING FOR
1023	Because I had a chance to talk to people I know.
1024	i was able to get on line with out any delay and I was able to check my mail in a timly maner
1025	because i like ABCD   just not the spam 
1026	spam
1027	It's not worth the price....the new software I installed (2.3) does not allow me to receive text only email - my only option is to receive html mail.
1028	GOT DISCONNECTED WHILE PLAYING A GAME.
1029	"NOT DOING ITS JOB.  TOO COSTLY.  TOO MANY DISCONNECTS.  WAAAAAAY SLOW GOING TO EVEN AN ABCD WINDOW. TOO MUCH ABCD CRAP RESIDENT ON FAVOITES.
1030	ABCD did not freeze on me ( for once). and ABCD also did not disconnect me either ( which happens quite often as well)
1031	ABCD keeps freezing while I am in the middle of something. I own a fairly new computer and do not believe that this should be happening that often. I also am not happy with all the spam emails and popups as well as how long it takes to get online.
1032	I just am.
1033	"No problems occurred.....I didn't get ""knocked off-line"""
1034	just checked e-mail
1035	not happy with the way customer service has handled recent problems.
1036	i find what i need
1037	was able to download what i needed in a good amount of time 
1038	No disconnections.  
1039	i read my e-mail and no pop ups came up
1040	I only had to check e-mail and didnot recieve any popups 
1041	no answer
1042	pop up ads. monthly billing rate. bumping off line. slow to load.
1043	I was able to find the information that was looking for quickly.
1044	I Had find everything I needed in a short period of time which is very important.
1045	i was able to conduct a web search fairly easily in order for my family to be able to find a new rental home.
1046	there are more affordable online services that offer unlimited online hours for a better price than ABCB.
1047	I had a place to dispose of my spam e-mail/ return and block. However there is no way to totally block the BAD knock-knocks that interupt me when on line.
1048	I was not satisfied
1049	Got on line pretty fast,and did not get kicked off line as some of my neighbors do at times.
1050	get the information that i needed 
1051	"it was very easy to connect with whateveri wanted to look at and very ""user friendly"""
1052	my free trial with ABCD will expire
1053	familiarity with use, internet access, and ability to communicate with other members.
1054	well if i get connected its always good i know my way around ABCD so i am satisfied with it.
1055	Everything worked fine. Was able to get information that I needed.
1056	COST COMPARED TO COMPETITOR ISP
1057	NO WAIT TO LOG-ON AND NO BREAK IN THE CONNECTION DURING MY SESSION
1058	I didn't get kicked off.
1059	Do not use
1060	i did not have too many delays to websites i wanted
1061	it got me to where i had to go and fast.
1062	was able to sign on and use the internet with ease.
1063	easy to use
1064	price
1065	find all info I need but when can u get rid of the penis enlargement and smut emails.I DONT HAVE A PENIS AND DONT THINK ID WANT THE ADDS IF I DID HAVE!
1066	speed of internet
1067	The price is expensive, and it is really irritating that they choose to bump you off line when you are idle for a length of time. Sometimes you are in the middle of something and loose it all and have to start over, it should be my choice to go off line, even if I am idle I connected first and should be able to stay on until I decide to go off. Also the mysterious disappearance of things in mail and files has me wondering what you guys are up to
1068	 had fun playing games
1069	The cost and slowness is my main reason. I've also encountered some very rude people that didn't help when I called on the telephone.
1070	"I was able to speak to a fluent English speaking person;I had called earlier and the person was difficult to understand and spoke rapidly and too softly.The next person stayed on the phone an hour trying to help get me online to no avail. This person(John?)was courteous and gave some other options"
1071	No problems.  Can always depend on ABCD's service.
1072	worked well...no problems...got on with first try..didn't get kicked off during accomplishing task
1073	we solved the problem in min.
1074	I just type in a keyword and it takes me to where i need to go. Fast and easy.
1075	I was able to navigate to the sites I needed to get to.
1076	"Too many pop-ups ---- all the ""SPAM"" is very distracting."
1077	itwas ok
1078	didn't get kicked off while online.
1079	getting kicked off so much.
1080	Problems with Spam and it seems when you try to get technical support these people barely speak English also a lot of busy signals for my local access numbers.
1081	I could visit the places where I wanted to go easily and quickly.
1082	Ya'll didn't boot me off the 'net....
1083	don't know
1084	because the quailty of service that ABCD provides, I do on line banking,pay bills,check on my retirement 
1085	i had no problems
1086	I enjoy ease of use, news features
1087	got a response from customer service 
1088	  It's not really a visit I'm just checking my mail.
1089	All of the junk mail I have been getting since I upgraded to 2.3.  The price is to high compared to other services.  The spam sounds good but it is more of a hassle.  Thank you.
1090	I like what ABCD offers just wish they didn't keep dumping me
1091	Didn't get booted off, e-mail loaded normally, message board loaded normally.
1092	it worked
1093	Can get online and check info and off real quick
1094	I was able to get the info I was looking for quickly.
1095	Eastaccess, readable
1096	I got the information I was looking for and did not encounter any problems
1097	Too many pop up windows, too many advertisments, lack of use for key ABCD components versus general internet browsing
1098	I use ABCD all day.  Nothing changes my satification.  I am only dissatisfied about ABCD when I get my bill at the end of the month.  I am upset with myself for paying 14.00 a month to have these email accounts.
1099	job related
1100	just ok with the service
1101	I am easily connected.  ABCD 2.3 is easy to use.  All in all, I think you're doing a great job!
1102	eazy use
1103	everything worked without interuptions
1104	It is to expensive.
1105	because it didn't crash. it does a lot. i have an older brouser and it is to fast sometimes
1106	pop ups and marketing pressure
1107	price
1108	I was unable to sign on, it took over three tries to connect. Once connected I was bumped off three times. so I signed off for the night. this has happened often
1109	my email is always screwing up, and the main reason I have ABCD is for the email. then, whenever I call to talk to an ABCD rep, they usually ignore what I'm saying and advise me to do things that I told them TEN times I already did. Plus it is too expensive. I pay all this money for a service that doesn't work right half the time.
1110	there were no glitches that time.
1111	was able to access new and e-mail easily
1112	For a lower price
1113	I had no problems
1114	Took care of what I needed very fast
1115	I was able to do what I needed to do fast and easily.
1116	I was able to get on with the first try.
1117	It's easy to use.  I can check on stock quotes and read e-mail easily
1118	The cost of monthly membership
1119	I was able to get all the information I need.
1120	it is nice to get on line and don't have to wait 
1121	"While I do not have a high-speed connection, I feel that ABCD responds well, has good ""quick contact"" otions, and the dial-up connection works well."
1122	it was easy to find the info i neeeded
1123	Ease of getting the information I was after.
1124	I didn't get bumped off and it wasn't terribly slow like it can be sometimes
1125	could not make proper connection and price
1126	help i recieved
1127	i got done what i needed to get done but with some minor problems....dont know if it was the website or what...
1128	if it goes up more
1129	everything worked
1130	i just do not like the service and the customer service people are not friendly at all. and the service is entirley to expensive
1131	I get one line quickly and I dont get booted off.
1132	I just had to check my mail and it is so easy and convenient to do that.
1133	ease of use, clearity of content and user friendly content
1134	Cost, to many other companies who offer ISP cheaper rates. When you call ABCD you are guaranteed 15 minutes + before you can speak with someone.
1135	Did what I needed to do and got it done. ABCD is a great service, but the cost with the economy at this time, it terrible. Should have a family plan where you can have two accounts one at regular price, 2nd half off

1157	I had a good connection, no disconnects, and got into the site I wanted with no problems.  
1158	For one thing, I didn't have so much junk mail as I usually do, so that was a good thing.  I always have fun when I'm using ABCD, so I am mostly always satisfied with it.

1173	ABCD is just very easy to use. 
1174	just up graded to 2.3
1175	Constant interruptions with 2.3--screens I don't want.  Frequent and long delays in accessing, sending e-mail, etc.
1176	Took me 3 tries and a long time to even get online.  Then.... contending with pop up screen, etc.  Then.... long delay in sending.  A pain.
1177	everything went ok
1178	I didn't get kicked offline thats always a plus 
1179	good connection and stayed connected

1201	It was OK
1202	Because the solution was remedied in a timely manner without confusion.
1203	Due to the amount of usage we have and the dollar amount we pay for that usage. 
1204	I was able to find the data that I was looking for on line. The search is easy to use.

1216	I was able to find what I was looking for.
1217	FOUND INFO I WANTED
1218	Nothing impeded what I wanted to do
1219	Found the information I was looking for easily.
1220	Price is the only reason.
1221	There does seem to be less spam, and I appreciate ABCD's efforts to limit that.  It's hard to say why I was satisfied with my last visit though because I very seldom have anything by a very satisfactory visit at least.
1222	Everything ran smoothly.
1223	everything went smoothly.... in the past I have had difficulty with dial-ups and ABCD not responding
1224	its easy to get rigt were you want to go

1243	local cable
1244	no particular reason.
1245	server on web links are always busy or out of order
1246	POOR DIAL UP SERVICE. LOOSING CONNECTION FROM ABCD  AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. UNABLE TO GET 56.0KB DIAL UP SPEED.
1247	It was easy to get on, and I was able to visit my usual sites.
1248	easy to use 
1249	I read the news
1250	i could not access my mailbox and then was booted offline, which happens quite frequntly. 
1251	I've found that after ABCD raised the prices to 24.95 per month that it's getting rediclious to pay this amount. I'm extremely likely to purchase cable modem service and use AIM.
1252	no pop' up 
1253	Because it gave me what I was looking for. 
1254	I go online every night.  WE are currently living in Georgia and all of our friends are in Michigan and the email experience of being able to stay in touch with them has made our stay here much more rewarding.

1263	I really can't think of a thing
1264	ease of use
1265	EASE OF USE 
1266	Can not reach any web site.  Through the search mode.  I could get a web site 65% of the time through key word search but hardly ever in search.
1267	It was ok
1268	junk mail and security issues
1269	parental control
1270	The cost and too much pop up ads, junk mail and bad e-mails
1271	i found what i was looking for
1272	Better Service
1273	Everything worked well.
1274	The higher price of ABCD makes it cost prohibitive.  I pay an extra $5.00 to not gave it show up on my credit card.  This is a ridiculous penalty.  I use ABCD mostly for the  unlimited internet access.  I can get that for less elsewhere.
1275	Unlike other times, I wasn't kicked off.  I consider that a good time on ABCD.  I'm generally on for long periods of time.  This leads to a higher possibilty of being kicked off.
1276	"ABCD IS THE EASIEST SERVICE TO USE AND I CAN MOVE THROUGH THE PLACES THAT I NEED TO GO WITHOUT A LOT OF HASSELS. I USE THE ""KEYWORD"" AND ""SEARCH"" ALL THE TIME AND EVEN WITH MISSPELLING ABCD MANAGES TO GET ME TO THE PROPER PLACE."
1277	ABCD does not always work the way it should. Sites dont come up. Have to reboot to get a better connection.
1278	Cost to much. Other online services are cheaper.
1279	I  was  able  to  get  done  what  I  was  wanting  to  do  .

1283	I was not thrown off line
1284	Easy to do what I got on line to do
1285	moved faster
1286	I didn't have too much trouble with connection, I had no crazy errors and slowness while online.
1287	Only 2 dial-up numbers for access, not always working.  Frustration with slowness of connection.  Aggravation.
1288	because i was safe online, and i ahd no junk mails and no web sites popped up and i like it when its ays i got mail!
1289	I wasn't booted within the first hour

1302	because it was not slow at all and the news and weatther is always updaed/.
1303	I was able to find what I was looking for.

1305	fast and easy
1306	it's very fast no pop up ads better connection
1307	Not much lag time 
1308	GOT INTO GAMES FAIRLY FAST TODAY
1309	Too much junk mail, too vulnerable to hackers, no need since I have a cable modem.
1310	I didn't get knocked off line.
1311	Cost is high for the kind of service I receive. I am knocked off the system many, many times.

1445	It's easy to use, convienent, and has up to date news/information. 
1446	Price....We pay a monthly membership for a cable modem.  The company who provides our modem, also offers free email.  However, we like ABCD, but in addition to paying $40 or more a month for the modem, we have to pay an extra $15 just to have the convenience of ABCD.

1834	I and my friends are being continually harrassed by a group of people, two of whom claim to be friends of ABCD employees. They continually threaten us, continually call me a cripple or gimp (I am disabled) send us disgusting IMs and emails, hack into our computers booting us and getting our passwords, stalk us in chatrooms and attack and name call and ABCD does NOT do anything about them. When we respond to them in kind WE get Tosed. Apparently ABCD treats white male subscribers differently than they do women. I also found out that some people are charged lower rates for the same unlimited service.
1835	It is easy to navigate with ABCD
1836	The parental controls are not blocking porn spam e-mail from my son's screen name.  I have him setup as mature teen.  Everyday there are at least 2 to 4 porn e-mails sent to his screen name.  I am tired of blocking and reporting it.

1862	it was quick 
1863	The person I spoke with was polite, friendly and very knowledgable, and his name was Bruce.  He should get a raise.  But there is woman Sasha who works for you who is the rudest person I have ever dealt with, and she should be fired.
1864	I do like ABCD but sometimes I have to get reconnected.  And that takes a lot of my time. Also when playing games many times have top reconnect.  Otherwise I like ABCD

1909	I GOT ON FAST AND WAS ABLE TO FIND WHAT I QAS LOKING FOR.
1910	good information, fast connection with searches. Blocked spam from my email.
1911	tech support fails to completely listen to the problems of the customers ABCD 2.3 is still giving me problems even after following the instructions of tech support which their standard reply is uninstall and reinstall.  I am tired of asking as this is the only answer they seem to know.

1945	I had no problem dialing up.  I was able to access the site I needed to, and had no pop up advertising.
1946	Price too high. Billing too confusing.  When I have called in the past to cancel, I have been convinced not to because of promises made, but then I feel that things don't work out the way they are suppose to.
1947	it does exactly what i want it for with the least amount of grief

1963	Took long time to get on, then was kicked off

1966	I can access my email from any computer
1967	helped me find what i needed
1968	Downloads were reasonably fast
1969	I moved a little faster, but I am usually satisfied

1972	The Service, and the price increase, I have to many problems for the amount of money i spend for this service.

1984	"ABCD have it all, i just click the ""TV LISTING"" icon and there you go, you have it. i dont have to waste my time to type it up"
1985	because i'm using cable right now, and paying double for ABCD and other connection is just too much.
1986	i keep getting kicked out of sites or not being able to get on them all togather
1987	it went well
1988	I was able to do what I log on to do.
1989	The speed at which I was online and I received an email from someone I don't know and ABCD prevented me from opening it. It came up as the page could not be displayed. I believe there was a broken link on it or from a SPAM BOT that ABCD blocked.
1990	I WAS PUT ON HOLD BECOUSE ,THE GUY I WAS TALKING TOO HAD A PROBLEM WITH ALL MY TACHNICAL PROBLEMS,,HE COULDNT ANSWER ANY ,HE HAD TOO KEEP ASKING PEOPLE THEN HE FINALY PUT ME ON HOLD AND LEFT ME ON THE LINE FOR AN HOUR BEFORE I HUNG UP.
1991	TOO SLOW ALL THE TIME,,AND I GET KICKED OFF ALOT ,,IM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE SRVICE AND I AM CURANTLY SEARCHING FOR A NEW SERVICE,,I HAVE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE.
1992	I was able to get on line without the usual several attempts.
1993	wasn't disconnected abruptly
1994	Ease of getting around in the different windows.  
1995	Tired of the spam. And the ABCD advertised junk mail they send, as well as when you sign on they make you click a no thanks button on alot of junk they are selling and for the money you pay for ABCD service compared to other providers that is B.S. They do this often as you sign off as well
1996	becouse it is fast
1997	that i found a cheaper acount
1998	Cost compared to other companies
1999	I like the new being sent on my front page, then I can know what is going on right away.
2000	The person I spoke with had a lot of information to give me. Very informative.Very helpful
2001	too slow
2002	"Constant slownesss,interruption and freezing. Welcome screens keep popping up.One just did.They often do not leave but block ""X"" box and stay on.   "
2003	It takes to long to call to get assistance.  Also when I khad technical problem and called for help the ABCD technician change my telephone contact number and, even though it was same area code I ended up with a large charge on my telephone bill which amounted to approximatly $600.00.  No one would help me.  I was on the phone for hours trying to get help.  Some persons were very rude, especially in billing.
2004	the person I spoke to on the computer gave me a telephone number that didn't require such a long wait and then the person on the telephone gave me another telephone number that also didn't take too long so compared to the usual terrible expericnce it wasn't so bad.

2117	Read my e-mail and it worked quickly for a change

2129	My primary use of ABCD is email, and I use several computers for this, including an old 486 running Windows 3.1 with which I use ABCD 1.0 (I prefer this because it eliminates all graphic material.)

2150	"ABCD doesnt offer any rules based email spam filter this is troublesome due to teh fatc I get at least 7-10 emails a day asking if I want to enlarge my penis ! U hate having to block each email address as this is time consuming. A simple filter to block any emails with the title ""enlarge"" and or ""penis would make this easier .

2177	I checked my e-mail, easily and without any trouble.
2178	I was supposed to get an email from a customer service rep with information that was supposed to keep me with ABCD. I did not get the email.  Supposedly what he was going to send would make me change my mind about staying with ABCD.

2320	SPAM!  XXVD8 offers complete SPAM protection!
2321	Yes, however, I would like the ABCD search engine to be of higher quality. 
2322	I feel I am getting my money's worth in terms of uninterruped service now that ABCD is blocking pop-ups. They were very aggrevating and for a time, I did think about changing to XXVD.

2348	No problems with what I was doing online
2349	I can find my way around very easily

2354	the speed of getting to where i wanted to go and and ease of getting there
2355	I got on and was able to do what I had logged on to do.
2356	retreiving mail and sending mail is very easy.  we are in the process of getting a new computer as ours is too old to upgrade to 2.3.  can't wait to use that.
2357	I GOT BUMPED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF WRITING AN EMAIL
2358	THERE ARE GETTING TO BE ALOT OF WEBSITES THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE ON ABCD THAT I CAN ACCESS ON XXG

2383	All ABCD features worked as advertized.
2384	I know how to use it .
2385	It is very easy to use
2386	The connection failed on 2 different access numbers and then could not reconnect and booted me off. Also, the welcome screen takes too long to load.
2387	The overall service has continue to slip during the past year. Also, the pop-up ads and overall commercials take up way too much space on ABCD sites. There is also no way that for as much as they charge, that the consumer is getting the value for the price.
2388	It was trouble free. I got on right away.
2389	Just enjoy being online with ABCD.
2390	I was able to complete what a wanted to do/

2405	constantly got disconnected or lost connection
2406	budget at this time would not allow me to keep the service
2407	Received the information I was seeking with littlew effort.

2449	Another internet service provider has moved into my area and has features such as those found on ABCD.  There services are advertised at a lower monthly subscription price than the unlimited ABCD service of $23.90.
2450	I was not only satisifed with my LAST visit, but most of my visit to ABCD.  ABCD has easy acess to information when you need it.  I think that is probably the reason why I am most satisfied with ABCD.
2451	I was finally able to get on and did not get a busy signal
2452	Nothing bad happened
2453	no problems 
2454	Explainned  how tthe problem could be  fix and did it,

2457	very inforative
2458	easy access, easy to use,
2459	No Comment
2460	ABCD is very expensive. I cannot afford it.
2461	I did everything I needed to do while I was online.
2462	Finally everything worked properly with no errors.Things were running smooth for a change.
2463	It is too expensive and customer service phone numbers are almost impossible to locate and the customer service reps are not very friendly.
2464	"Price keeps going up.  I am often disconnected or find it hard to connect. Programs keep changing-- I was hoping to get free ABCD once in a while but my ""miles"" disappeared.  When I try to get help I get longlong  emails that confuse me instead of solve the problems."
2465	i did what i needed to do and had no problems
2466	received the answer i wanted.
2467	Easy to move about on line
2468	I seem to get all that that I need or am looking for. ABCD people are very helpful.
2469	ABCD did noty shut down while on line. Information needed was received.

2481	Ease of use. Found what I was looking for in a timely manner.
2482	I will possibly be changing to high speed service through my cable company.
2483	Signing on line is with great ease.  Today, I had the opportunity to block pop-ups.  ABCD offered me the opportunity to download a program to stop all pop-ups.  I am very pleased with the outcome, as well as, the new version of 2.3 which added more features than I anticipated..eg.  the Report spam button.  
2484	Easy to use
2485	i get the news before the tv.
2486	Getting cut off line.
2487	I got high speed cable and now I don't get kicked off and it was faster getting online
2488	I was able to log on with a decent internet speed connection and get the information that I needed to download easily.
2489	I was satisfied with my last visit to ABCD because, as like every other time I sign online: 1) I was connected to the internet quickly. 2) I had just spoken to Ted in Billing, and he solved a problem for me.
2490	I got courteous replies, offers were made that I was not aware of, more information was given to me than I knew existed in the ABCD network.  The staff was patient, helpful and very informative.
2491	Everything worked as it should. No hassles. No delays
2492	Easy to use, quick connection
2493	ease, speed 
2494	Easy to locate what I needed.
2495	new web pages 
2496	Pop ups are all over the place. The Match Chat function interupts while you are in an IM or typing a mail, the level of unwanted pornography you are sent by simply being online, the poor ability to connect with ABCD and their outdated dial ups and the frequency of being booted each time online has gotten much higher. 
2497	easy on and off no brainer to use simple
2498	was able to remove spam a wonderful tool,very satisfied with service
2499	I accomplished my objectives.
2500	it shows all information i need.

2507	found what i needed to find
2508	It took more then 20 mins to get online and once on, I was booted off within 10 mins and not able to get back.
2509	the amount of time it takes to get online every time I attempt to log on, and the fact I am booted offline often while logged on.
2510	No reason
2511	All the pop ups from ABCD. I thought I read a month ago in the newspaper that ABCD was stopping the pop ups but I get more than ever.
2512	easy to get my email and play slingo
2513	didn't have any problems connecting - like the headline news - site is easy to navigate
2514	the customer service person, was nice and walked me through the problem
2515	Well i found what i was looking for

2530	i am able to check email from work.. and i do that alot, and i like that
2531	I like ABCD.  I wish it were cheaper, but it's a good service.  I've seen the cheaper and it was a pain in the neck.
2532	no paticular reason i use it daily
2533	Got online did what I wanted and got off. No delays
2534	The news notified me of a very happy event
2535	I got the information I needed
2536	Too many pop-ups, junk-mail
2537	i was satisfied because no problems occured 
2538	Sending email was very slow.  Took 5 minutes or more per message sent to get the your mail has been sent message
2539	i was able to conduct my business in a timely manner
2540	The use of ABCD is easy
2541	ABCD is so easy to use and I can access it from work, which is nice since there are times I am expecting an email from certain people.
2542	My curser wasn't disappearing like it was doing the last week or two
2543	no problems
2544	it was fun 
2545	it takes too long to log on. i get knocked off frequently.

2548	I just checked the weather.

2564	Everything I used performed as I expected it to.
2565	I finally got online after about 10 minutes yesterday.
2566	It takes me too long to get online.  It will sometimes take me 30 minutes to get online.
2567	Just went into email which always simple
2568	pROMPT ATTENTION AND RESPONSE
2569	I was able to talk to my family and friends
2570	had connection problems with 2 phone numbers

2872	I have high speed internet access at home. But when I connect at work, I have to do it thru dial-up, and the system is so slow, it takes for ever to load pages and sometimes it doesn't even load at all. I called ABCD to report it and they suggested me to call tech support. I havent' done it yet, but I will as soon as I can
2873	My questions were answered timely and with the upmost knowledge in there position.
2874	didn't get disconnected again
2875	NO PROBLEMS
2876	I pay 12.95 and only get 20 hours online. That is more than half of what it costs for a full month of unlimited service. There is 720 hours in a month. Half of that is 340 hours in half a month. I should be getting 340 hours not 20.You are penalizing people who can't afford the $24.00 a month or don't use the web that much.
2877	I wasn't disconnected and didn't have to wait for too long.
2878	My husband does not like it at all.

2883	No problems, no bump-offs... reasonably quick access to mail and internet
2884	I use ABCD mostly for email and the ABCD E-Mail is so easy compared to other programs I have used.
2885	i dont understand why my bill was so much and i have been very upset
2886	double billing
2887	Satisfied due to the fact that my service does not cut me off while i'm in the internet.
2888	I did not know about the games and now I do.  It was fun.
2889	It is easy to use and I am set up with the things I am looking for.
2890	Erratic service, line drops, error messages that mean nothing, service very slow at times.  Tried to correct problems (not of my making!) with Buddy List this morning and couldn't get that function to work ...
2891	Found duplicates on my Buddy List, don't know why they were there (Family2, Buddies2, etc.) -- tried to access Buddy List from People drop down menu to remove them and couldn't access.  Tried a number of times ...
2892	ABCD is quick and easy to use.  I love the quickness and it is easy to navigate and find what I need on the net as well as within ABCD itself.  
2893	Good Service, easy to use
2894	logged on quickly and logged off quickly
2895	IT WAS FAST AND COMPELET, WITH WHAT I HAD TO DO.
2896	Cost of service and my availability to finally connect through my cable company
2897	connected quickly and was able to do what i needed to do
2898	because the rate is too high!!! I have EFGH ISP and it is way too expensive. The price is only a few dollars less than the regular service.
2899	there is no reason to be dissatisfied  with my visits to ABCD it is the PRICE that I am not happy with.
2900	EAse of use
2901	i like the new blocking pop up it makes it that much easier to enjoy your sites
2902	there are 2 things that bug me about ABCD one is the support of the ABCD tech. there are times when i need help and they don't give good professional help. i was told by a tech to delete a file and that file was not to be deleted. so i wish they would have better traing. maybe you can come up with a system where we get live help from a tech and beside there name is a symbol or a # telling there rank as a tech. like a 1 would mean very skillfull and a 4 would mean just a starter so if the problem is server then we can ask for a better tech. you get the idea the other thing is the price of ABCD i wish it was lower thats why i been looking at other internet services because of thr price now that we have to pay more for gas.

2913	"I get cut off for no apparent reason, every single time I am ""on-line"" and it is very frustrating!!!!!!"

2915	I live on a limited income so I have been contemplating a more reasonable server. I have stayed with ABCD because in the past they have been kind to me and gave me some free time to help me through this tough time in my life. However, I am still in the same boat, so not sure how much longer I will be on line with ABCD or anyone for that matter.

2955	I got things done that I needed to get completed 
2956	ALL WHEN WELL
2957	I was able to check my email.
2958	Everything seemed to go well.Got on line easy.

2960	The access capability was good.

2968	I found out what I wanted to know.
2969	Too much advertising. The screen is too full.
2970	As usual I was able to get where I wanted to go and complete my objective with ease.
2971	Ease of use.  I know my way around the ABCD menu and have no problems viewing what I want.
2972	Everything was fine, 
2973	Billing dept is very unconcerned about customer satisfaction. The last time I called billing I waited for a very long period of time.  When they could not help me they transferred to another section of customer service where I waited for an equally long time.  After spending nearly an hour trying to solve me problem, I finally gave up from fatigue and frustration.  I still have the same problem I called billing with originally.
2974	I just addressed this in my last narrative.  To put it briefly, I had a billing problem - I held and waited(twice)- I spoke to two billing dept. men - After about an hour I still had the same problem I started with.  And still do!!  
2975	checked my email
2976	ABCD kept disconnecting me from the internet. Reading my e-mails was very slow due to the volume on ABCD.
2977	I do not like being disconnected while I am completing an application on the internet.
2978	My cable modem is working correctly and I didn't have to close out ABCD before going to a web-site
2979	I got right online.I did not have any popup's come to think of it and I was not disconnected.

2988	I always get the news first thing in the morning
2989	Because I was able to fine everything i was look for.
2990	for what I use ABCD for I am satisfied
2991	ABCD service is very consistent. it is very convevient to use and very user friendly
2992	it took me forever to get on line.  couldn't figure out why!!!!   i keep getting this popup that i am asking for a connection. don't know what that is either. but it keeps popping up when i try to get on or do some research.
2993	sometimes i get locked up and can't use my computer!! a lot of times it is slow to respond.  even getting on line. i get a lot of junk.  i tried to get rid of some not favorable items. such as enlarge penis.  i am female and i don't know how these thinks get on my computer i don't even get into anything that might be considered porno.
2994	 ease of finding preferred listings, email notifications, 
2995	cannot surf past a few links without screenfreeze
2996	found msg board interesting
2997	connection was immediate
2998	Found Info
2999	Price, Increased spamming and ad banners.
3000	ABCD is always easy and you never have very many problems like other online services
3001	easy to go from one area to another
3002	it was pleasant and rather user friendly. I enjoy my time online but as I have only had ABCD and no other isp to compare to I cant relly make fair statements other than to say I am satisfied. ABCD provides what I need when I need it.
3003	Talked me into keeping ABCD In a way that was fair.
3004	Found what I was looking for.
3005	No problems
3006	Connects at 26400 baud, again ridiculous!!!
3007	Execesive fees for slow connection. Ridiculous!!!!!!
3008	it didn't kick me off
3009	everything just went fine 
3010	I was able to accomplish all I set out to do.
3011	I'm on a free trial, and I can't afford it.
3012	2.3 doesnt seem to work too well and slowed things down

3015	not sure
3016	I didnt get booted off or anything
3017	not enough local numbers
3018	always get online the first time I try. Plus have never been kicked off.
3019	The monthly cost is to high and is continually going up.
3020	The technician was very polite and knew his job well.
3021	Because of the disconnections and inability to download fast enough and the ability to go to different web pages with speed. 
3022	Continuously being bumped off, the slowness of it, and it cost too much.
3023	because ever since adding 2.3 to my computer I have had nothing but slow connection time,etc..
3024	adhered to the probelem and then solve with a little assist also
3025	i found everything i needed easily
3026	everything i was looking for was found easily
3027	I was somewhat satisfied - still getting alot of spam and porn - that I send to ABCD.  
3028	Everything worked perfectfully.
3029	The news portion of ABCD gives me a quick overview of what is going on in the world that allows to then decide to go to one of my other news websites.
3030	The rep was very good
3031	Easy use.
3032	My husband had a stroke and I can't spend the money on ABCD at this time.
3033	A recent call to a supervisor about a problem in the billing department.  A worker there I talked to assured me that a credit would be put toward my credit card that not even active anymore didn't note it in the computer. The manger said he couldn't do anything about it cause it was not noted.  One call to the cancellation department to Cassie, who solved the problem and keep me as a valuble member and didn't treat me like the supervisor did.
3034	I'm always satisfied with the way ABCD performs
3035	It was fast
3036	because i got my imformation right away
3037	solved my problem temporarily
3038	Ease of use
3039	It is too expensive and I have found a cheaper nationwide service.

3041	I didn't have any problems getting online.
3042	I had a easy time going on line. I was able to access infor-mation.
3043	I accomplished what i had set out to do
3044	playing buckaroo blackjack
3045	EVERY THING RAN SMOOTH AND I HAD NO COMPLICATIONS AS I SOIMETIMES DO
3046	ABCD enables me to connect with my family and friends easily and also search for information, etc with little to no difficulty.
3047	the eaze of getting on and off line
3048	everything was good, and worked as it was suppose to
3049	I got on line fairly quick and had no specific problems such as getting bumped off.
3050	No problem.
3051	Now have cable service and I'm also trying to keep the monthly bills to a minimum.
3052	There were no problems
3053	I was able to connect with the internet in a reasonable amount of time.
3054	Too costly and too many pop-up ads.
3055	I'm not sure I undersatand this question.
3056	I couldn't log on, it said it was my tcpip connection but the internet on every other part of my computer was working, just not ABCD
3057	The money factor.  Being a student, i really can't afford it. My bills are way too high. the more i can cut down the better
3058	Because, I was able to find what I was looking for easily, Due to ABCD search.
3059	did not take so long to log on

3081	I got bounced off two times
3082	I'm looking for a lower fee and not getting bounced off so often
3083	Price is too high!
3084	insufficient funds
3085	my mouse was dead and I could not navigate
3086	I have to contact ABCD live tech quite a bit. problems w/screen freezing up and hourglass a lot
3087	bad connection, slow internet 
3088	too expensive
3089	fast logon.... no glitches in my pc
3090	because someone figured out my password and sent emails on my screen name plus ordered porno which im extremely against and they also used my charge card to do it-and ABCD treated me like i did something wrong -instead they should have been mad that a customer was hurt> it was handled like people treat me around here-everyone uses me and hurts me and steals from me and nothings ever done about it. Some teenagers had fun and exes and their friends. ABCD should help customers who are victimized not blame them.
3091	everything worked 
3092	information
3093	price
3094	I log on in the morning to check news, weather & email

3099	yes but seems to be slower
3100	Quick to solve the problem. Polite. Asked if I was satisfied w/help.
3101	Because I knew what my intentions were before getting on line.
3102	I JUST LOVE ABCD I THINK IT IS THE BEST OUT THERE

3104	I didn't get thrown off.

3107	they keep closing my chatrooms i have made.
3108	did not get bumped off-line with phone calls
3109	no pop-ups
3110	price
3111	because i didnt get disconnected
3112	yes, except for the uploading part, i seem to wait for sometime to start checking my email. there are too many things uploading
3113	Too expensive for only using e-mail.
3114	after talking with one of your reps , found out more info I didn't know, so will be able to do more things.

3126	ABCD WOULD FREEZE UP ON ME
3127	BAD CONNECTION

3129	very user friendly. Informative too.
3130	Everything seemed to go smoothly
3131	Connected to ABCD reasonably fast
3132	got information fast.  found what I wanted
3133	Got online quickly
3134	No connection problems, Enhanced e-mail with ABCD 2.3
3135	I was able to check my email & print some info from the internet
3136	The Macintosh version for my IMAC is not as good as the PC version
3137	Quick and satisfactory delivery of service.
3138	It seems expensive for the time I use it. Maybe if there were better rates.  Also I get disconnected often, which makes it annoying.
3139	well I only went on for a few moments, so there is not much to say.
3140	I was able to get the informtion I was seeking with no problem.
3141	i don't know! because i checked my e-mail and didn't have any problems.

3146	Pop-ups and lost connection with local host
3147	FOUND EXACTLY WHAT i WAS LOOKING FOR
3148	It was fine,,just wish we could get some faster hook up numbers in my area,,,
3149	I checked my email
3150	I just checked my emails.
3151	I was able to check my home e-mail from work
3152	Customer support and tech support lack of real tech knowledge and a willingness to tell you anything to get you off the phone.
3153	Had no problems
3154	I say that maybe I will cancel my membership with ABCD because I have a very low budget and might not be able to afford it, nothing else than that. I am very satisfy with the service
3155	I was able to find what I wanted, like always and it was fast, it took me just a few second for it to display.
3156	I got right on and did what I wanted
3157	I use e-mail a lot more now than I did before. ABCD 2.3 is pretty good.
3158	for cheaper service
3159	I found what I was looking for.
3160	i found everything i was looking for.
3161	Did not get kicked off and my email went through

3177	EVERYTHING
3178	Ease of use
3179	After the president made his little announcement on TV. i came online to chat in a room about it. I was upset, and said some bad words, not to anyone, just cursing in General. While someone was TOSing someone else, I got caught in the fire, and was TOSed! Which isnt anyones fault but my own, but i seriously think ABCD should have more room monitors! The porn IMs are out of control, not to mention the porn poop in the chat rooms. Boot everyone out. Thats my opinion.
3180	fasr browser
3181	I use it everyday and I am pretty much always satisfied
3182	It was the fastest I was able to sign on in a few days and not disconnected for any reason.
3183	I like the windows provided to access web sites,etc.  but I had difficulty so I had to turn off my computer asnd re-start it to get back on to web sites,etc.
3184	connect quickly
3185	no problems signing on or going from one site to another etc.

3190	no problem's easy to get my e- mail
3191	Cause the connection wasn't that slow.  Also there weren't that many pop-up's.
3192	I'd say the price of the service.  My local provider offers the same things for a cheaper price.
3193	was easy to get online and check e-mails and get on the internet.
3194	I didn't get booted
3195	I was't on-line for very long. I just went on to check my e-mail, but everything was fine. There were no problems.
3196	the easy to use mail and no pop ups

3216	i didn t get booted off for a change
3217	Everything was as usual with the exception of my mailbox being temporarily unavailable. This has never happened before.
3218	i get on fine. i dont know cause i have never had anything else and iam just happy withit 
3219	Connection was good this time..you never know.
3220	In pompano beach area code 954, you have reduced access Numbers from 4 to 2 in the last two months.  Also hold on the line too long for customer service.
3221	I had no problems looking up all the items I needed to see.
3222	I could access my mail and message boards.
3223	The ads on the message boards are a huge reason to cancel. I keep ABCD only for the message boards and they are down often, they have a flashing ad at the top and it is annoying.
3224	i love the new features, it makes ABCD easier to use and get around. 
3225	found what I was looking for
3226	I got the info I was looking for quickly.
3227	"nothing too much went wrong - usually it says ""not responding"" every time i try to go somewhere and i an't get off line because it does not respond"

3233	I was able to find the information I was looking for
3234	i got on line quickly
3235	It is easy to get where I want to go.

3237	it performed the way I expected a online service should perform
3238	Very helpful with general Info
3239	expensive
3240	fast connection
3241	I got on fast
3242	money,my hours at work was cut.
3243	Everything worked fine...not too much spam on my mail.
3244	Everything worked
3245	I read that they were going to add software to reduce pop-ups
3246	Everything was very slow.
3247	I was kicked off line 5-`10 times and had to resign on. Then I could not go to other internet sites so I signed off and was mad that I still have ABCD and have not switched to another service.
3248	I found what I was looking for
3249	If I don't get more finance in here I won't be able to afford internet service soon I'm sorry if it don't get better ,My kids and my home is more inportant then the computer .So hopefully  I will get on my feet soon.  Thank You!
3250	All the options.  the email extras, etc.
3251	Price.  
3252	did not get disconnected. and the server is always up for the most part.
3253	I didnt get kicked offline or have ABCD freeze up for once
3254	Easy, I did what I wanted to
3255	I'm looking for a job
3256	I took care of my business.
3257	everything run smmothly
3258	read news and e-mail
3259	i didn't have any problem getting on line 
3260	The ease of getting online.  Also most of my friends are on ABCD.
3261	help me very will no
3262	was just checking E-Mail
3263	easy to find what i was looking for
3264	Got all the information I was wanting.
3265	service
3266	the tech helped me solve my problems. he name was Andrew!
3267	change to on line service that is cheaper
3268	getting on line was fast
3269	I was able to acces the information I was looking for.
3270	i CHECK MY MAIL SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE DAY. ONE THING i DO NOT LIKE IS A POP-UP FOR SIGNING ON A FRIEND WHEN I AM SIGNING ON TO MY ONLINE BANKING.
3271	Because I got on
3272	Dial up is too slow and very busy sometimes.
3273	iT WAS JUST EASY
3274	kept getting kicked off after it took several trys to get on
3275	real so getting on usually takes 6 or 7 trys
3276	As always ABCD makes it easy to get around.  Getting information is quick. Information searches are simple.
3277	The site I was looking for came up faster and seemed quicker than usual.
3278	"Because I didnt ""freeze"" up, and ABCD finally allowed me to send email!!"
3279	no problems
3280	didn't get cut off
3281	easy to use 
3282	ease of checking my e-mail, and playing pogo games
3283	Great Service
3284	ABCD does not offer High Speed Internet access in my area.  I will probably switch to High speed in the next few months
3285	i changed dial up number and it was faster
3286	too slow of service
3287	It provided me with the means to find the info I needed quickly
3288	ABCD  is easy to figure out, but I must say I like the format of Microsoft outlook much better. I like when my typing errors are corrected, underlined or hightlighted so I don't always have to hit the ABC button on ABCD.  Many features of ABCD are great, but I find Outlook to be so easy and simple to use.  I find I have to push or punch so many buttons on ABCD to get what I want.  I like everything to be on the screen and all I have to do is punch it.  
3289	i wasn't because i tried to report spam and it appears it didn't work because it didn't remove from my email list..i was using ABCDanywhere....ALSO...the more i use that feature, the  more unsolicited emails i get...WHY
3290	i was able to get on-line
3291	Was able to do what i wanted with ease and without interuption from annoying popups.
3292	I didn't get kicked off.
3293	price
3294	easy to use, easy to navigate.
3295	i found what i was looking for without any problems
3296	The rep was very helpful adn gave me a lot of information as to why I should keep ABCD so I am trying to do this over then next two months.
3297	I needed some info from a web site and I was able to get it fairly quickly
3298	Money.
3299	i mainly use the personals and now i have to pay ABCD to get the site and pay the website to answer the ads. i don't like that i pay ABCD so, it should be free!
3300	no one there to chat with and keep getting unwanted mail.
3301	I had no problems with anything all my mail opened for once
3302	the ease of going online and looking for what i need and i had some fun on the internet
3303	I WAS NOT, THEY KEPT ASKING ME IF I WANTED TO CONTINUE WHEN I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. I WAS BEING RUSHED AND INTERUPTED OVER AND AGAIN.
3304	I got what I needed
3305	end of free trial
3306	keep getting booted off
3307	the service is extremely slow...and I am tired of always getting booted off.  The new pop up ad blocker is awful it doesnt stop anything!
3308	because I could get online and open mail without getting an error message and getting booted offline
3309	Because I accomplished what I needed to get done with little or no interuptions.
3310	it took me three times to connect to ABCD
3311	Because I keep getting knock off line, and i have only one phone number that works. and yall keep going up to much and there cheaper company out there
3312	I was able to get the subject I wanted easily
3313	I got online, current up to date news, and emails without all that junk email. Im dissatisfied because ABCD crashed twice.. other than that, my online experience was peachy
3314	Don't plan on canceling
3315	Getting connected is an issue, I have to wait sometime five or more minutes for telephone connection, and them when I do get one the connection may last for only a few minutes and then I have to dial up again and wait. This I am very dissatisfied about.
3316	I had an operating question and it was answered clearly and quickly.
3317	I signed on and had uninterupted service for as long as I wanted to be on-line
3318	Had no problems being disconected
3319	Found what I was looking for.
3320	easy to reach and read. able to pin point what I needed
3321	There were no problems.
3322	I got result to what I am looking for.
3323	It is too expensive
3324	was able to use email and visit various sites on the internet
3325	We always get kicked off line and it is not worth even close to as much as we pay. They should also be able to send a bill but they won't so it automaticall gets put on the credit card and w do not like that at all.
3326	Had no problems getting on line, got my mail easily.
3327	Easy to get around, didn't get bumped offline.   I beta test, so sometimes my software locks up on me, but that is an issue I work with the beta team on.   I feel that (on average) with ABCD's mail system, I am less likely to get a virus from someone who (for instance) uses Outlook.
3328	ANother provider
3329	I was able to use the services efficiently
3330	monthly bill a little higher than i would like to be paying-problems with technical dificulty
3331	technical problems
3332	No pop ups, easy to sign on
3333	I am a trivia host every morning in a private room.  My best cyber friends show up regularly.  That's one reason, but there are others.
3334	the only reason why i was somewhat satisfied was because the customer service person help me out ok.
3335	information needed was found
3336	I was able to get on and do the things I needed done with a minimum of disruptions and adequate speed.
3337	Price
3338	ABCD is very to use, its not complicated like other internet sites
3339	i enjoyed it
3340	it got me to my web page I guess
3341	too expensive, the ability to store passwords is too much work. hate the pop-ups
3342	all wen well
3343	computer was moving fast
3344	My last visit included getting rid of the annoying pop ups.
3345	because i was trying to download updates from microsoft and it never would finish
3346	i was able to find the info i needed easily
3347	lost connections
3348	with  the  manner  in whic  it was  hanndle  and  the   clear   information  iwas gave   the tecg  was  very  kind   and  had  knowledge
3349	"ABCD is far too expensive.  Even on different payment plans, it's expensive.  Also, it doesn't help matters that I was flat-out lied to about this site, Opinion Place.  I was told by an ABCD rep that I could visit the site 10-15 times a month; not every 2 weeks.  Had I known that, I would have cancelled it right then, when my trial membership ran out.  I just kept my service because it was convenient, and still is."
3350	It was a very quick visit to find out some information.  I didn't have too much time to get assaulted by pop-up ads and other annoyances.
3351	A small glitch getting on but I did get on Ok
3352	Can not afford ABCD
3353	I think ABCD is great just a little too expensive.
3354	Sometime ABCD just looses connection even if I didn't really loose connection on My ISP.  
3355	No log on problems. I do not get booted off when I am online.
3356	service is just great
3357	because of excellent service............

3382	BASICALLY THERE WERE NO INTERRUPTIONS.
3383	I didn't get kicked off
3384	I don't like the new message board format.  And the cost of ABCD services is too high.
3385	THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS VERY GOOD AND PROVIDED ME WITH THE INFORMATION THAT I WANTED.

3396	Because my email was promptly sent and I am able to chat w/ my friends.
3397	"Too Slow, and too much spam"""""""

3415	Usually have good on line experiance.
3416	I did not have trouble but with one thing and that was not being about to get my e-mail wallpaper to stay what I want it to be.  Otherwise, I did not have any problems.
3417	I DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS GETTING ON AND DOING WHAT I WANTED TO DO!
3418	IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE!OTHER INTERNET SERVICES ARE HALF THE PRICE.
3419	Always getting kicked off line

3421	I am always satisfied with ABCD.  I never have a wait to connect, and I always find the information that I need.
3422	I was satisifed because I didn't get bumped.
3423	I was on a website and for some unknown reason ABCD cut off my connection and took me offline. I had to log back on, go back to the website and completely start over what I was doing. Nothing was saved because I wasn`t able to finish. This has happened before numerous times. I previously contacted ABCD and they instructed me on a fix. It did not happen for quite a long time after that, but now it has begun to happen again.

3439	I was satisfied because i am getting less junk mail then ever before.

3481	usage vs: cost
3482	The connection was extremely slow.  It takes a very long time to connect, and then every page I try to open takes a very long time.  Sometimes the pages just fail to open.
3483	ABCD has a convenient user interface, though sometimes it has a problem with freezing up.  I like the spam and popup controls.

3514	everything went ok
3515	Easy to get on-line and surf the internet for sites of interest and to search the internet for a particular title. ABCD IM service makes it easy to see who's on the entire internet and contact them while online.
3516	I was playing slots for fun and I really enjoy this entertainment that doesn't cost me money.
3517	I could download games easy and fast.
3518	No problems. I am disatisfied with the amount of spam I am receiving. I am aware ABCD is working on reducing spam but I get more spam with ABCD than with other email addresses
3519	Thye monthly fee is becoming to expensive....and it seems like im paying for a service hat should be free considering all the advertisements I feel I'm forced to read.
3520	had no problems getting on, staying on
3521	Because the man I talked to was very good at explaining the service to me
3522	I have been getting booted  a lot lately.
3523	the ease ofgetting on line and the simple use of information of the online service
3524	All seemed to go well, except that I could not send a quick e-mail to my daughter - waited to this morning to send it.
3525	less unsolicated emails
3526	The onlinre operator got right to the problem and offered to email me the instructions so I could more easily use them.
3527	Because it worked.
3528	When you call or via chat the support is always different answers and no-one seams to be on the same track.
3529	Received mail, easy to navigate
3530	It gave me all of the latest updates on the current war, weather and its easy to check my email.

3539	double billed
3540	fast connect
3541	because i was constantly overcharged, charged double or even triple for my account.

3545	I am familiar with ABCD and I can go right to the areas I want to find information quickly and easily.

3551	Arnold was very patient with my problem and supplied the needed information
3552	I was able to visit the sites I wanted.
3553	My computer does not have the memory to convert to 2.3. It seems since the introduction of 2.3 the speed of my access has diminished and the amount of SPAM has increased a lot. It's like I'm being punished for not changing.
3554	because i got through to what i was looking for in less time from before
3555	The help I received did manage to stop the majority of the problems but I still got 4 or 5 popups last night.
3556	I was not cut off once and I found what I was Looking for easily for a change!
3557	there is too much advertising for stupid stuff
3558	I was booted offline by ABCD.
3559	Their rate for service is too much for what you get.  I constantly get booted off the internet.

3561	im moving out of state
3562	it showed me how to solve my problem with my diconnection from the service
3563	Because it updated & downloaded the pop-ups.

3565	because i was able to navigate easily and quickly, and I do not get kicked out anymore.
3566	i`m satisfied with all my visits.  i get online more than once a day.
3567	Smooth to get on and off... no problems.

3569	Didnt get  booted had a pleasnt time online with the informative news
3570	got the information i needed and had no problems while on line
3571	It's changed dramitically.  
3572	JUNK MAIL, INABILITY TO SIGN ON, AND GETTING DISCONNECTED. 
3573	The tremendous amount of spam and its disgusting content that I receive each day.  Also the difficulty is signing on and the ridiculous reasons that pop on my screen.  Also becing disconnected too frequently.
3574	pop ups
3575	easy access, quick conx to web page, easy use of buttons and tools
3576	I was able to get in fast and do what I needed to do.

3585	I READ MY EMAIL
3586	Everything went smoothly - no disconnections, which are usually my sole complaint over the past year.

3588	found what i was looking for.
3589	quick & easy
3590	moving out of state
3591	east access
3592	The cost and we still get knocked off once in a while.

3601	Easy to use and found what I was looking for.
3602	Ease of connections
3603	I logged on, I managed to get my mail and not get beachballed.
3604	poor service, sex services advertized in profiles available to youngsters, unstable software, capricious application of TOS standards and dispensing of violations
3605	I didn't run into long waits for the sites to load.
3606	No Problems
3607	"LDRS needs to do their job on the message boards. I get harrassing posts and emails from ""trolls"" constantly even though I have never posted or emailed them. Something needs to be done or get rid of the message boards all together."
3608	There are many reasons for my decision.

3611	I was able to access the site i wanted and able to obtain the info i needed.

3615	well, i am also using beta software... and sometimes it works great other times it doent.. today a new download made it work just fine
3616	had a few new e-mails from friends
3617	everything i looked up i found.and its good to chat with friends and family
3618	I enjoy the ABCD service and ease of use. I don't enjoy the cost.
3619	because i did not get kicked off line, that seens to be my biggest problem with ABCD
3620	Able to access the sites I wanted to visit with no problems
3621	I get to see what I wanted without any interuptions.
3622	i got done what it wanted to
3623	because I got on line quickly and they had what I was looking for
3624	Too much junk mail on my accounts.   
3625	I got to listen to my music on the radio online
3626	computer did not crash while browsing

3653	its ok i guess
3654	the ABCD fees too much
3655	the ease of use
3656	It's always there and I can get what I want
3657	Poor phone line connections.
3658	slow connection and slow website loadings
3659	I got on without getting booted like normal. That really gets annoying but, not today.
3660	For the price that they charge, I do not believe you get good enough service. I am always getting busy signals and when Im on, I get kicked off frequently.
3661	I did not get kicked offline and the connection speed was good.
3662	nothing was wrong
3663	No problems with while online
3664	because I felt that a ABCD representative misslead and decieved me when I called them in January concerning the package I requested. That representative told me I would have unlimited hours for the next 2 months, but this was totally false based on the amount of my ABCD billing statement. I believe that ABCD should reconsider the complaint that I filed on March 23,2003.
3665	I like using email with various fonts & colors.  I like using the Buddy system.  I like taking polls.
3666	The ease of geting where I need to go.

3676	because i didn't get kicked off the computer
3677	It's easy to find my way around ABCD, get help & find favorites. I like the look of the screen, enjoy Instant Messenger.

3734	When support moved offshore, it became truly worthless.
3735	I found what I was looking for.
3736	do not know
3737	it worked
3738	The representative I spoke to was a gem.  She gave me the information in a timely fashion. And she seemed to understand my confusion.  I have kept her e-mail address,in that I feel she is someone I can trust. Of course, she was very personable. Thanks for having such a nice person on staff.
3739	I found the bit of news that I wanted with no hassle at all. I just had search to do and was shown on the first try where I could find out the information I wanted.
3740	Rarely have technical problems.
3741	I was able to everything I wanted to do and did not get any pop up ads.

3752	I did not have a problem logging on to the Internet.  I have the dial-up. In the afternoons and evenings it takes longer to log onto the Internet and sometimes the Internet cut off for no apparent reason and states your connection has been lost. This need to be corrected.
3753	I was able to get the information I wanted.  I would have been more satisfied if when I first signed on I wouldn't have found 13 pieces of spam mail.
3754	It was one of the few times my connection was not broken during my session.
3755	I was able to find info without being cut off
3756	I got a good E Mail from a friend.

3759	I AM ABLE TO GET ON VERY QUICK. I AM GLAD THAT I HAVE IT. THANKS
3760	I checked my mail and there was less spam then usual.  The connection was good (I have a cable modem) becuase sometimes ABCD is very slow.  I was able to open my mail quickly, sometimes I can't.  I was still signed on from earlier in the morning, I don't enjoy being disconnected from ABCD.  So all was right this time.
3761	I didn't have any problems signing on or off and did not get kicked off
3762	Pop up ads when you sign on and Pop up ads when you try to sign off.  Getting kicked off while trying to download tax forms after almost completing the download.
3763	ABCD is to expensive
3764	"I had a billing problem and went to ""billing"" to get a toll free number to call and had difficulty finding a phone number.  i saw the talk to someone online about billing and could not access that.  i finally found the toll free number and talked to a human and got my problem resolved."
3765	Money
3766	i was able to sign on fast
3767	Becuase nothing messed up, just visited my websites and got off.
3768	Quick and informative, no problems.
3769	I was checking war information and found it right at my fingertips in a quick fashion
3770	didn't get booted off, was able to complete all that I needed to do online.
3771	too expensive, get lot of unsolicited and junk mail, get booted off unexpectedly.
3772	because i is easy to attach pictures when sending e-mail
3773	I am currently shopping for less expensive internet access. The service is fine, but the price is too high.
3774	It is easy to navigate, but it is the only internet service I have ever used.
3775	ABCD signed me off twice before I got into the Internet area I needed to check.  
3776	We have a hard time signing into ABCD, and it takes a long
3777	
3778	Didn't have any big problems
3779	My husband and I are senior citizens with large medical bills. We are on support from our children and some county facilities.  We are having to cut down on many things.   We don't even check out VCRs.  We play cards.
3780	I did not get logged off
3781	it's easy
3782	Due to not getting what I pay for. Can't get embedded images in some of the e-mails I get and getting the WABCD error message alot.
3783	I got all the information that I needed with no unexpected problems
3784	easy access to most of what I need
3785	Because I was bored and ABCD was there
3786	was able to get online immediately
3787	ALWAYS HAVE INFORMATION I NEED
3788	Everything went ok, no problems, but again response time wasn't the greatest.
3789	The main reason is that we are leaving the area and relocating but another reason for considering cancellation is the poor response time.
3790	ease of finding information
3791	I was using my favorite places feature making it easy for me to do what I needed and got off line

3800	it did not throw me out this last time..i would very much like to get the i won out of my computer and am unable to do so.
3801	it helped me find information I was looking for in the search screen, and corrected by spelling.

3814	cost
3815	"busy signals when trying to access ABCD and service ""freezes"" and/or knocks me offline"
3816	was able to log on, get the info i needed. isn't that the reason i subscribe?
3817	easy access, keeps information secure but too expensive
3818	too expensive
3819	because they changed the billing date and it comes at a bad time and they said I can't change it.
3820	Nothing went wrong
3821	IT SEEMED TO BE MOVING FASTER
3822	"Everything seemed to work okay; not getting disconnected; program didn't stop working; speed in accessing domains seem to work okay without hanging up."
3823	i didn't have any problems.
3824	the price of the membership
3825	I had the pop up blocker on, and I was not disrupted with annoying pop ups from the internet.  Also, I did not get bumped offline because of busy circuits or ABCD problems.  Everything was perfect!

3828	I was very pleased that I was allowed to easily click off stuff so that I could finish my conversations

3842	connection was good and all wedsites where accessed easily.
3843	I blocked over 40 popups

3863	I just read my mail and did a quick check on war news
3864	They helped with the problem.
3865	because I kept getting bumped offline in the middle of things, can't upload or download because of constantly getting bumped, and my kids want to go online, too, when I'm online.
3866	Information I received was non political or otherwise motivated.  It was concise and very easly understandable to me.  So many news articles are used to taking up so many column lines, and this makes an otherwise good article so much trivia.

4055	Have been receiving offers that are less per month with some free months at the start.
4056	It was easy. No surprises.
4057	Everything went smooth, and I found the info. I needed very easily.
4058	First, I was able to log on without any problem.  Second, I was not kicked off of the site at all during my visit.  Lastly, I was able to report and block spam without any problems.
4059	Easy email program
4060	cheaper providers
4061	user friendly, and instant messenger
4062	found what i was looking for
4063	too expensive
4064	it did not freeze up and give me an ABCD error message
4065	I was able to complete my on line tasks without any interference
4066	Got online. did what I needed to do.  However there are too many pop-ups
4067	when I am online,ABCD is OK,there are just too many service  interruptions and difficulty to log back on.
4068	The price is too high compared to other providers
4069	all work satisfactory
4070	I was able to sign on and did not get kicked off. Also, I was able to get to the internet fairly quickly.
4071	it worked
4072	Because I had no connection problems, and was able to do all that I wanted to do in the time that I was logged on.
4073	for some reason the connection was really slow. then once i got online the speed had really slowed down. i don't know if there was alot of people online. but it took me forever to move around to my normal websites that i go to. i even disconnected and restarted my computer to see if it was my cpu. but even when i reconnected it was still super slow.
4074	did not have to wait to check e-mail
4075	have seen advertisements for on-line service at lower rates. I am on a limited income.
4076	Got online quickly
4077	It is hard to log on. always loosing conection
4078	i was able to stay logged on
4079	I found information for which I was searching easily
4080	I had just downloaded 2.3 so I had not had time to enjoy the benefits of the new download
4081	Priceing is the only reason
4082	I hardly use it and it cost too much.
4083	It's like any other internet service to me.
4084	moving
4085	cost
4086	was able to get to e bay  in time to bid on a closing auction
4087	The girl (Terry from Texas) was very nice and answered my question.  ABCD was having difficulties everywhere, which is why I couldn't sign online.
4088	cleared mail out real quick and got done what i had to do
4089	I didn't have any problems making contact and since I had quite a bit of e-mail I did not go on the internet, which depending upon the site can be somewhat frustrating....which of course is not ABCD's problem.
4090	Planning to buy a new computer and obtaining high speed internet service.  I understand that ABCD will be offering this service at the end of the month.  If the price is reasonable I will continue my ABCD service
4091	It was easy to receive and get my messages etc...
4092	I called customer service to cancel my membership because of money problems, not dissatisfaction.  The representative told me about this place(opinionplace)to help me earn free ABCD time and he also gave me 2 months free ABCD to help.  Any experience I have had with anything ABCD has always been top quality.  My ABCD visits are like a visit with an old friend.  I know and love what I find there.  It doesn't get any better than ABCD!!
4093	ive never had a problem with my ABCD
4094	It did,nt freeze up on me
4095	no pop up and quick page loads.
4096	out of a job so cant spend money on internet right now.
4097	because ABCD cuts me off, to go offline, so ABCD can upload data.......wait til i get off......stops me in my tracks.  Do not enjoy restarting my computer.........

4099	its normally what i expect

4102	nothing went wrong
4103	the price and the customer service is awful
4104	no pop up ads. email was there, favorites were there. not diconnected.
4105	I got the information that I needed to get
4106	Found what I was looking for.
4107	Got everything done I wanted to.
4108	I love to read the news online. And it is always up to date!!

4130	Pop Ups and Porn
4131	I was on the $12.95 plan, my kids left the computer on and walked away a few times, and my last bill was $83 dollars. Rip-off! I feel swindled. And all of the Viagra, Mortage, and Titty e-mail that comes in to me is, quite frankly, for the fucking birds! sorry

4142	I am used to using it...  But will change If I am billed again...and If my ABCD visa points wasted
4143	"unwanted ""spin Off account"" rude customer sev. agent to fix this problem being unprofessional.  Not recieving my awards and using my ABCD visa and still being billed for the 3 times after being on the phone way too long to get help with the billing.  They might give u a free mo. but then a bill comes the very next mo....."

4146	I checked my email and I had no technical problems.

4404	well everything went good getting on line. no busy signal.
4405	well my children use the computer more than i do. my children are moveing to there mothers for 6 months so i will not need the service as much...another reason is because ABCD charges to much. i can get internet service for only 9.95 per month

4445	just checked mail. looked at headlines.  joined an on line chat. (sometimes I think chat rooms are occupied with pre-teens) looked at weather. did some surfing.
4446	because, i usually don't have a problem with anything on it
4447	busy, and not really using it much
4448	I wish can be more simple to find things
4449	Pop ups keep show in
4450	It was quick and I quickly moved through my searches....
4451	FAST
4452	PRICE
4453	I didn't have any problems.
4454	I did what i wanted to do and it wasn't a problem
4455	I had a good time playing dominoes
4456	able to check email and chat on line
4457	price is going up
4458	can't afford it
4459	the price
4460	Imediate information obtained in news and mail.
4461	information i needed was there.
4462	I did not get shut down.. or .. froze up ...( or interrupted by pop ups.)  Loaded quickly.....
4463	quickaccess,uptodateinformation
4464	too many freeze up on the screens, takes too long to load the welcome screen
4465	because of the problems i have while on line,frezzing up, can`t disconnect off line or pages want open etc,etc,
4466	didn`t get kicked off line , and didn`t freze
4467	BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO READ THE NEWS
4468	it was very easy getting on and going where i wanted to go
4469	I was on line a very long time and I was not disconnected nor did my screen freeze.Which has been happening alot lately.
4470	Found information I was seeking quickly and with no hassles.
4471	I keep getting booted this has been happening for several weeks.
4472	ABCD double charge me and the person that runs that department told me tuff, live with it
4473	because unlike most internet providers i didn't have to dodge pop up ads, or advertisment ads.
4474	befor i got booted i got to read  email
4475	all the information available on my homepage
4476	I had no problems reaching my games(if unable was told of the Problem)
4477	slow loading and sometimes when i log on, every page says unavailable so I have to log off and back on and it works. And freezing up too.
4478	No particular reason.
4479	I got the information I needed.
4480	because it was faster
4481	cant aford high prices
4482	I had a question for ABCD and was connected to a live customer service person for help.  They are alyays very helpful and nice.
4483	I was satisfied because I got on without problems and didn't have my service interrupted by anything.
4484	I don't feel that I'm getting my monsy's worth.  $23/month to be bombarded with spam and pop up ads is just plain stupid.
4485	because there was no spam in my inbox, and for once I was not disconnected.
4486	spam, connection interruptions, not being able to log on at all sometimes.
4487	ii like ABCD and am used to it
4488	there is up to date news and most of the topics I enjoy looking at.  Also ABCD gives some help with billing which I appreciate.
4489	i didnt have a hard time getting on line
4490	I was able to quickly locate info for which I was searching.
4491	not sure
4492	Easy access and fast searching every time
4493	just checked my mail
4494	for the amoutn of time I am on the net each month I don't believe the fee is worth it.
4495	just because
4496	non
4497	very easy navigating
4498	Ralph was very nice
4499	pop ups, unwanted solicitation, public broadcasting of my email address, lack of coordination between billing and customer service, generally speaking - your left hand knoweth not what your right hand doeth.
4500	unsolicited emails,pop ups. I want the whole net adresses available to me, not just the ones you decide to list. Time after time I can't get to what I know for a fact are valid net adresses because you system doesn't include them.
4501	pop ups were blocked, I found what I needed eaisly
4502	Obtained the information for which I was looking.
4503	Too much junk mail/ spam
4504	price, Junk mail, Privacy
4505	No bugs.  But getting too many popups on web, more and more unwanted junk and offensive mail and slower times getting to the net in general.
4506	I had no problem getting on and off. and checking my email is easy
4507	Because my problem was solved in a matter of minutes. No problems, no hassle.
4508	I got immediate results

4518	Customer satisfaction
4519	Found what I was looking for
4520	Because everything was as I expected it to be.
4521	because
4522	"The program didn't hang up and I didn't have to Click:""No Thanks"""
4523	too many adds
4524	"It doesn;ttake long to get on line. I can get to where I want with a minimum of time. I am a fairly new user and I can get the information that I need if I can figure out the question."
4525	i don't use the service as much as i used to, trying to save money, can use service at work.
4526	i got on, checked my e-mail, and got off with no problems.
4527	i got on line
4528	able to stay connected
4529	it was good no problems
4530	i did not get bumped !!! in over 2 hours

4532	no particular reason
4533	ABCD 2.3 is very easy and i find exactly what i want every time.
4534	UNABLE TO GET ONLINE
4535	Because I can not aford it. It cost to much money for me .

4537	I did what I needed to do.
4538	I got the information that I needed.
4539	My connection speed was good, and the mail was working (my primary use of ABCD).
4540	ALL WENT WELL WITHOUT INTERRUTION

4542	Coverage of war, health news, pictures available
4543	can find most of things that I need
4544	may have no time
4545	I was able to find what I was looking for in a very quick and easy manner
4546	never have a problem getting on and no problems when online
4547	I didn't have to wait to get connected and there were none of the famous ABCD glitches
4548	The news coverage on the war was extremely thorough and fairly objective.
4549	i find that i can get the info i need
4550	ABCD seems to have a wider search criteria
4551	Can't afford it
4552	I was able to play around on the internet.
4553	The price is too high.  
4554	email was prompt
4555	Its easy to use...
4556	My dissatisfaction had to do with the annoying interuptions of pop up advertising.
4557	price
4558	it is easy to do email and fun to enhance the colors, etc.

4562	ABCD is so asy to use
4563	I received several tips on a screen at the bottom of a page on one of the sites.
4564	the young i talked to fixed my problem and was very courtsey
4565	because i was shopping
4566	I AM GETTING XXVD BECAUSE ITS ALOT CHEEPER, AND ITS ABOUT THE SAME SERVICE LIKE ABCD.
4567	WELL I WAS SATISTY, BUT I REALLY HATE THE POP-UPS.
4568	In all areas.
4569	I just checked my emails and read the new on Iraq.  ABCD is very easy to use and has the latest headlines about our troops in Iraq.
4570	latest news
4571	monthly fees
4572	Not too much junk mail
4573	I was able to conduct my business as usual without any problems with ABCD.
4574	easy to use and i got the info. i was looking for with no problems.
4575	I found whwt Iwas looking for
4576	because i kep getting illegal operations,and cannot get problem fixed, tryed and tryed
4577	too many disconnects
4578	hate pop ups
4579	as always my exporing is made fun and easy
4580	News headlines

4582	because  I was able to take care of everything in a timely manner
4583	Didn't have any problems
4584	i got everything i needed to done
4585	I was able to contact friends and family during a time of day that was most convenient to me.
4586	because it frozed up on me you might want to fix that,but everything else is ok

4588	the cost and the proiblem with the free months service i was supose to get 
4589	I Had no prombems
4590	being disconnected
4591	i was dissatisfied with ABCD because it took so long to sign-on and it frooze up on me ..and also a website would not come up
4592	its because it always signoffs on it own ..its always freezing up on me ,,,andits not my computer ita ABCD
4593	because I didn't get booted and was able to check my email and read up on the news
4594	I can always do what I need to do online in a fast matter.  and it is easy also.. I dont have any problems signing on or getting kicked off at all.
4595	I was able to connect at 52K. The only reason I get frustrated with ABCD is because I am unable to connect at faster speeds during peak times.
4596	no problems
4597	too slow
4598	HAD NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER
4599	PRICE
4600	Allways easy access,nothing to complicate my experiance

4634	I was able to get an answer to a problem I had with someone billing my visa card without my  approval.
4635	Didn't get kicked out during my visit, which tends to happen rather frequently.
4636	Too expensive.  Once I moved from 2.5 to 2.3 I always get connected at a slower speed.  Too many pictures, graphics, etc.
4637	I was not satisfied with being kicked off all the time.  Ever since I downloaded 2.3 is kicks us off all the time.

4650	I got done what I needed to get done, retrieved my mail and logged off without interruption

4652	easy access
4653	cannot afford it
4654	had no problem with pop up windows
4655	No carrier lost.  Speedy internet access.  Good war information

4663	I am just satisfied with being able to cut down on the pop ups and what not.
4664	cause i never really have any problems
4665	i just was
4666	Ease of use. I think ABCD is the absolute BEST in that category!
4667	the woman from India was polite, understanding, and I fell, did everything in her power to help keep me as a customer.

4680	Non confusing and easy to follow
4681	Accomplished what I went online for
4682	I got in fairly fast
4683	no problems with anything
4684	The main reason would be the ability to afford this.
4685	easy to use
4686	everything worked well. I was able to access the info. i needed to find.
4687	i meant to say I will NOT be cancelling my ABCD membership.
4688	I found everthing I was looking for with ease and did not have to search hard for it at all.
4689	I talked to a billing consultant on line and they were very helpful in giving me information that I wanted to learn more about.
4690	There was quick connection and the speed was good
4691	they were very helpful
4692	I love Instant Messenger. It's important to me that I can talk to my sister on ABCD because it really cuts down on both of our phone bills.
4693	because i played the games that i always do
4694	because when I sign up my bill was suppose to be 21.95 a month and now im paying 30.00 a month and when i called and ask about it they were rude to me and told me to go ahead and change providers

4702	why not ?
4703	I like the ease of finding various information online.
4704	Too expensive..  I can't afford to keep paying this much when I can get the internet for less.
4705	Prices keep going up and I keep getting kicked off when i'm on line.
4706	i didn't get kicked off.
4707	Spam and cost
4708	offered help
4709	I had no problems surfing the net
4710	every thing went well
4711	BECAUSE I FOUND WHATEVER I NEEDED
4712	Very very slow.  I have noticed that over the last three months, the service takes an unusally long time to move from one site to another.
4713	ABCD didn't freeze up or have problems signing on.
4714	Always have problems getting signed off or signing on. Also, ABCD will freeze up and get an error message saying if the problem persists to report it to ABCD. Also, the price is way too high for the problems and headache it causes.
4715	Because I had no problems,as usaul
4716	Slow and too much money for the product
4717	I found the information I was seeking.
4718	It is fairly expensive.  Additionally, I do not like how there are downloads that occur automatically without my consent.
4719	I was able to find what I needed easy.
4720	There were no problems, but I don't like all the pop up advertising
4721	the technician seemed polite and informative
4722	I was able to send and receive my email.  I was not disconnected.  I was able to access some of the news I wanted to find.
4723	Cost
4724	No special reason
4725	Ease of finding your way around the net. I am just a beginner and it is easier than I thought it would be
4726	I wasn't bothered  family members to get off the phone so they could use it .
4727	it was fast and easy
4728	The cost
4729	didnt get booted of line
4730	Basically I just checked my email
4731	I read an email.
4732	"computer/ABCD; froze and I had to unplug the computer in order to get off line/unfrozen. This happens at least 5-6 times per week.  It absolutel never happens to my computer when I am not online.  BTW:  I have never called your customer servioce department with out being informed that the wait time is 45 minutes to one hour!  do your self a favor and call your 800 number and see how long it takes you to get through.  You will find that if you indicate that you want to sign up for service the wait is almost non-existant to get through to an operator.  Apparently you are there to sign customers up for your ""service"" but have little regard for your customer's needs for tech. support!"
4733	freezes too much--------says to report system response but can't because it is frozen.  Often times I must unplug the competer to get off.....un frozen.  Many sites, like Moo Cafe are restriced and I can't get on them.  serching for sumpthing and being restricted to something like ABCD Heath is beyond ridiculous!  And this is with Adult, lowest security rating!  These two are deal breakers from my point of view!
4734	Ease of use.
4735	The cost.
4736	I got on quicker than usual and did not get booted off
4737	Some days it takes to long to log on and I've seen cheaper online services advertised
4738	sometimes I can not get to the site it replys error ..
4739	Had no problems.
4740	short time to connect
4741	just checked email etc
4742	more pop ups, pushing ABCD merchandise, and goods, moving much slower than the past, would not give me aarp rate monthly fee too high
4743	I'm not happy with the phone service and 2.3 download.
4744	had no problems
4745	ease of navigation and research ablility.
4746	checked email
4747	TOOK ME OVER 35 MINUTES TO GET CONNECTED.  KEPT GETTING : UNABLE TO CONNECT TO ABCD.  AFTER BEING CONNECTED, IMMEDIALTELY GOT DISCONNECTED, AND HAD TO SPEND ANOTHER 20 MINUTES GETTING ONLINE.
4748	Always difficult to log on - numerous spam, etc.
4749	Logged on with no problem - connection made on first try. Was able to open mail - often times I can't even open my mail until I reboot and start all over again.
4750	No connection problems
4751	Basically, because I didn't have a reason not to be satisfied.
4752	Disconnection from the internet is too frequent. Price is also another major point.
4753	Cost,Keep getting kicked off
4754	was able to stay on line
4755	I obtained the needed information.
4756	Got the information I needed.
4757	i got on without much trouble and didn't get bumped
4758	to slow
4759	trouble getting on
4760	Ease of use of your service
4761	It seemed tobe easier to get on line.
4762	cost too much
4763	it was ok
4764	Better price with local service
4765	Checked mail, no spam, no pop-ups, in and off quick
4766	Moving to new house, not sure ABCD will be available.
4767	System loaded quickly and was on line....
4768	I can only say that for brief moment I was online, it went very well.
4769	i keep getting cut off by someone and then i just give up on it.
4770	the xost of ABCD is to high there are others that are cheaper
4771	Billing rates are extremely high for poor service rendered. Customer service reps are rude. Browser takes too long to load.
4772	"Constantly booted off the system. Error message is always ""Settings changed by remote host."""
4773	I checked my e-mail. didn't get blown out for a change.
4774	There continue to be issues with being booted for no apparent reason, with ABCD freezing up on a fairly regular basis
4775	I got information that I needed pretty quickly.
4776	would not connect with desired site
4777	had no problem connecting. only had to dial once for connection.  was able to find what i was looking for. also didn't have as much unsolicited email as unual.
4778	Service problems
4779	lost connection, had to reboot to get out of ABCD broardband.
4780	I was able to navigate around the web quickly to find what I was looking for.
4781	Connection was ok.  But once on to my banking site wouldn't come up took a few times for it to come up
4782	Pay day and my bank statement reflected that. I like on-line banking.
4783	was able to do what i had wanted to
4784	ABCD gets better and better every day with newe things and I get what i look for faster. I found what I was looking for about a month and I was very happy.
4785	THE LADY THAT HELPED ME HER NAME WAS CHRISTINE AND SHE WALKED ME RIGHT THROUGH MY PROBLEM. AND I AM NEW TO USING THE COMPUTER I AM LEARNING HOW BY A BOOK I HAVE BOUGHT MYSELF.
4786	I am recieving too much unwanted mail, so I would like to change my address.  Other companies have more minutes for less price and tighter controls on unwanted e-mail. I would like a bill to be sent rather than it be on my credit card. I would like to change the plan every two weeks instead of once a month.
4787	I just got my miald and that was all.  I also looked at how many minutes I had left
4788	Lots of conviences   I  Like the reminder service
4789	switch to different internet service  provider.
4790	I was able to accomplish the necessary tasks.
4791	Because I could get into my mail quickly.
4792	I have internet access through my local cable company
4793	It comes up pretty easy.  My computer is older and a bit slow.
4794	ABCD connections in my area never boot me. We have adequate local numbers to access it anytime.
4795	I got all the information I need in a short time
4796	cost
4797	read what i needed
4798	too slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4799	The cost about getting online services
4800	got info i needed
4801	There were no problems except the billing screen poping up in the bigging. I have been told by customer survice that this would be taken careof and it has not been done yet.
4802	I was able to do the things I wanted to do without any problems.
4803	i had no problems
4804	My connection time was fast, I went to the sites I needed with ease, however the pop-ups are extremely annoying!
4805	because everything went well, as usual.
4806	found what i was looking for but the speed to find it was rather slow
4807	"Mostly use ABCD for E-mail and have no problems with that.  But shopping and looking up info. if also not much of a problem.  However, the spam has not gotten any less; actually it has gotten worse lately.  Some days 3/4 of my e-mails are spam. I always report them but it doesn't seem to help at all."
4808	All questions were answered carefully and unhurried By a very courteous agent.
4809	everything went well

5007	Got online on first try.  Reported Spam and blocked.
5008	accomplished what I set out to do.

5010	I am frequently disconnected while in the middle of something.
5011	I was told that it would be 1 price, but then I check my creditcard statement to find out they are still billing at the old price.  I called in my complaint, I was told, well you didn't get the persons name, we don't have that billing plan!  Final answer, I am paying more than I need too.
5012	good service
5013	don't know
5014	was easy
5015	Couldnot get into the games that I like to play

5029	I can always find what I want with ease
5030	Right now I am paying for two accounts, my main account is my business address and I can't delete it.  Therefore I still have to pay for the two accounts.
5031	"Everything I want is accessible - the weather report locally and where I'm going to travel; and my favorites are within reach as is the icons I use a lot are on my tool bar."
5032	I may change to something more economical.

5048	Every thing is easy to locate and use.
5049	I can always get on line when I want to and it's always very easy to use.
5050	My mail problem appeared to be fixed......
5051	Everything went smoothly.
5052	Because I came online to play in worldplay and was continually booted out of the site
5053	Because they refuse to support worldplay games .. which is the primary reason i have ABCD instead of a free internet access
5054	I just went onlin and read my e-mail and went in to favorite places. I didn't have any problem
5055	I was satisfied with my last visit, because I can do what I want to do online.  I know how to do what I want to do and it is easier that way.

5058	EASE OF USE
5059	becaus,we get kicked off line all the time.
5060	Cost
5061	Everything worked as it should
5062	POOR QUALITY SERVICE.  SLOW SERVICE. COST OF SERVICE WHILE OTHER NEW/RELATIVELY NEW PROVIDER OFFER BETTER RATES.
5063	I wasn't expecting much.
5064	I didn't have any problems.
5065	I did not have the reconnect feature interrupt my activities
5066	It takes tooooo long to get from one screen to another.  The waiting is very frustrating.
5067	easy running
5068	I thought I was signed out of the service when I really wasn't.  My e-mail from one account ended up in another.  And too many pop ups
5069	Too many junk e-mails.  Out of 46 e-mails, 45 are junk.  I'm tired of deleating them.  And the service is slow.  It is also difficult to ask a simple technical question.  I did not know who to e-mail it to.
5070	cost/value
5071	dont know
5072	Didn't have any problems with service this time.
5073	Takes to long to get conected, and I usually get kicked off or my computer shuts down. Have problems getting information I'm looking for.
5074	I am a college student and ABCD is too expensive. I do need internet for research so i do need quite a few time five hours aren't likely to last me a month.
5075	It's really easy to find what ever you are looking for unlike other internet providers.
5076	It takes too long to get on line
5077	I got the info I needed
5078	B/c I was on as a guest @ someone's house and I didn't have any trouble getting online.
5079	I am usually always satisfied
5080	I DIDN'T GET DISCONNECTED.
5081	NOT SO MANY DISCONNECTIONS
5082	I did what I needed to get done online.
5083	It was fast and easy.
5084	could not send emails keeped being disconected and computer freeze up
5085	Easy access, controlled pop ups, got the information that I was looking for.
5086	I was getting updates on news, the war, the weather, etc.
5087	I can't easily access WorldPlay Poker, which I frequented.  Others must be having the same problems as there are just a few players now as there were many.
5088	Im'd my cousin.  Took care of some business.  E-Mailed a family member
5089	the price and ABCD is getting slower and I get kicked off a lot
5090	ABCD disabled access to system (apparently due to a hacker using screename to send unauthorized spam) without giving us notice (by mail, call, etc.) of the problem.
5091	no problems experienced
5092	there was no pop ups asking me to up grade my account
5093	when i send my money order in it takes to long to for you to cash it or you say you have not recived it yet...and then i have to wait a few days to get back on line ...thank you
5094	cause i have been able to finish without technical interruption.
5095	"i need a bill every month than obliging me to give access to my account, and the service is very expesive; moreover, it always intrupt me for some connection problem."
5096	I went into everything I needed to get to without any waiting time or problems.
5097	every thing worked fine
5098	unlimited usage monthly charge ($23.90) is too high for amount of my usage and 180 minutes for $4.95/month does not give me enough minutes---I could be happy with 20 hours/month for $9.95/month such as XXVD offers in their usage plans of which I presently subscribe to--
5099	I wasn't. I must have hit the wrong response key!
5100	It's familiar and easy to use.
5101	The cost..  I only use it for playing and it's more than I want to pay.
5102	ABCD WANT TO SHUT YOU DOWN TOO QUICK
5103	TOO MANY CRASHES,AND TOO HARD TO GET ON LINE
5104	I was satisfied because it is easy and convenient to check mail and to note the top headlines without spending too much time.
5105	famililarity of the system
5106	Becuz I was able to chat with my friends. ABCD is my browser and it does make it easy.. too bad ABCD can't make a newer version for MACINTOSH that is NOT for MAC X for some of us that have slower processors and cant afford fancy or newer systems!!!!
5107	I love ABCD
5108	Price
5109	Quickness
5110	"It was a short visit and very few ""pop ups"" appeared disturbing my experience."
5111	Slow, never ending software glitches.
5112	Technical glitches.
5113	It was up to date and there were no pop ups.  I found everything very easily.
5114	Din not have any problems that occurred
5115	have RR
5116	talking using AIM
5117	ABCD is more expensive than all other carriers. I am contantly getting knocked off line and 2.3 seemms to be slower than the previous versions.
5118	It was a quick visit to read my e-mail and read up on the news with the war in Iraq
5119	Dial-up is too slow.
5120	"I was able to connect on the ""FIRST ATTEMPT"" and I was not ""BOOTED"" at all!"
5121	I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT TO ABCD IN A TIMELY MATTER, AND COMPLETED A SEARCH I WAS LOOKING FOR.
5122	Just had time to check emails and play a little pogo games.
5123	I was able totalkwithfriends and family and geet email from son in the war
5124	Everything went smoothly.
5125	I was able to do what I needed to do without any hold ups or problems, such as logging on and being knocked off.
5126	I accomplished what I set out to do.
5127	Easy to find things that I needed.
5128	because i was able to do what i needed with no problems
5129	I was able to get connected with no problems.
5130	bills too high
5131	I was billed for 2 accounts
5132	Now that I fixed my computer, things run well.
5133	did not experience any problems or delays
5134	installation was awful
5135	Expense.  Now that I have A cable modem, don't see the benefit of paying for ABCD
5136	because  it  was  easy  to  sign  on   and   very  fast   to go  and  come   off   sites   and  no  pop  up   and   scams
5137	it was just a quick visit to check email. it didn't crash.
5138	Retrieved info promptly
5139	It didn't boot me offline and the internet was actually working for a change.
5140	The internet never works, they update what seems to be every other month, its very slow, and it boots you offline at any random time.
5141	There were no problems.
5142	able to obtain the information wanted
5143	easy access and found info desired easily
5144	I am dissatisifed with ABCD's attempts at controlling spam, I get way too much
5145	I was able to do what I needed to do
5146	was able to retreive the info I needed.  Easy to find
5147	Had a technical problewm which was quickly solved
5148	I Got what I was looking for.
5149	Money, Poss. lose of job

5152	Easy to find what I want
5153	Got on quikly, did what I wanted to do and was finished in normal amount of time
5154	Didn't get booted
5155	I didn't have trouble connecting to the internet.  ABCD is very easy to use and I enjoy the service that they provide.
5156	IT IS VERY EASY TO USE
5157	Easy to get on.
5158	i got information i needed and used my immediate messaging and got my emails so it waas good
5159	"Too much SPAM in my mailbox!!!  I have used the ""Report Spam"" option, but that does not seem to reduce the amount of SPAM, in fact I feel like I get even more SPAM."
5160	didn't get kicked off  the reason i keep ABCD at all is the greyhound message board
5161	we are EFGH and $9.95 is too high a price and we still get kicked off when we sign on thru ABCD but not optimonlone
5162	I was able to find what I was looking for rather quickly
5163	expense
5164	no problems
5165	I was able to send many e-mail messages.
5166	I had no problems to speak of I just used it like I normally do to read e-mail look at the latest news or play games or do research
5167	no technical problems...ease of navigation
5168	The cost is high and I don't use too many ABCD specific features to justify staying with ABCD.
5169	provided a fair service
5170	did not get locked up

5534	all of the pages I visited came up with no problem.
5535	I enjoyed chatting with my friends, without getting knocked off.
5536	It is slow and customer service is not that reliable
5537	The speed at which I was able to pull up sites was too slow
5538	well i was satisfied with my last visit becuase i needed to research a subject and i had used the keyword key which saved me alot more time!
5539	"90% of the time when i connect to ABCD every website i try to go to i get ""page cannot be displayed"" and it is frustrating not being able to connect to any page"

When I tried to call the service techs, I found out all the techs were in India......!  It was difficult to speak to some due to their accent, and the others didn't seem to know what to do or how to help me.  By the time I was able to get someone who understood the problem, my cellphone died because I'd been on the phone so long.  In the meantime, nothing was done about the problem and, although, it seems a bit better, I don't know if it will continue.
5793	I got online easily, the browser worked correctly, the pages opened with ease, and ABCD did not hang up and punt me offline.
5794	The information was there with one short word.

5839	i was able to locate site's
5840	At that time, I was just using ABCD as my ISP.  I found that ABCD works well both as an ISP and as a total program of internet communication.

5858	other than not been able to open a questioner from an  insurance company, my last visit to ABCD was very satisfing. May be my system dosn`t support this E mail document.
5859	Seems to take forever to get signed on.  It is slow and I think they just want us to pay more to go to the faster connections so I think that is why it is so slow.  
5860	I had no problems. Except for those annoying big pop up ads.
5861	It didn't disconnect me, and I was able to access desired web sites easily. There were no problems.

5881	went smoothly.  got online without trouble, moved around without issue.
5882	i had to wait a long time to get an answer
5883	less money

5885	ease of use, ease of finding online sites

5948	I was able to find everything i was looking for about my research paper and my emails were all there
5949	easy to gat online and find what i needed on the web as i am a new computer user...i love all the icons...makes it easy to navigate
5950	I am an American and when I need help I would like to speak to Americans not people from other countries. I am unable to understand most of them and therefore do not get my problems solved without several phone calls.
5951	games are slow in all game rooms visited. Chat is slow. ABCD is slow.
5952	Financial situation, and computer is acting up- keeps saying I have performed an illegal operation, and will be shut down.
5953	able to get on when needed
5954	ABCD would not fully load and encountered (yet another) failure and i was disconnected
5955	the pop up control was working very good. it stopped about 5 pop ups.
5956	I was able to work on ABCD with fun.
5957	i wasn't cut off
5958	System worked properly

5972	new 2.3 plus
5973	service was very quick and have been a member for a while
5974	i like the new options.
5975	I waited a long time to hear from you....finally i got a member - and was satisffied with her answer. and her help.
5976	ABCD has always been easy to navigate to addresses that I am interested in - however I do not like pop ups -i wish ther was a way to eliminate then all together
5977	Pop Up ads
5978	no pop ups
5979	"all things seemed to operate fairly soomthly; and reasonably quickly!"
5980	I found what i was looking for with out any problems
5981	Cause I had no problems...
5982	The time and ease thatit took to take care of my business
5983	tech support knows nothing

5989	I just am extremely satisfied with ABCD in general and the last visit was no different.
5990	i had no problems, this time.
5991	Inability of ABCD to resolve my billing problems.
5992	connection speed is not what it used to be, pop ups are increasing even with blocking, and spam is terrible.  More controls are needed
5993	THE SERVICE WAS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED.  I GET ANGRY WHEN I ATTEMPT TO LOG ON OR LOG OFF FROM THE ABCD SERVICE AND MY COMPUTER SCREEN FREEZES UP.  I THEN HAVE TO SHUT MY COMPUTER OFF TO RESTORE MY COMPUTER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.
5994	EASY SIGN ON, AND HOW WELOCME SCREEN KEEPS ME INFORMED ON CHANGING NEWS STORIES
5995	nothing went wrong.  On occasion I lose my connection to ABCD
5996	Pages seemed to load pretty quickly, did not get booted
5997	Just worked like it was supposed to.
5998	got on easy and found what I wanted

6003	QUICK SIGN-ON
6004	TOO EXPENSIVE
6005	signed on no problems no disconnections ABCD working
6006	too much email and IM spam
6007	I can get to wherever I want without any problem.  But the spam is really getting me.  I have to report at least 10 or more a day
6008	e-mailing took forever, and blocking e-mail was not working the right way.
6009	I was able to log on on the first try for a change.
6010	I wanted to see if I had any E Mail and I found that I did. 
6011	for the most part I am happy with ABCD. however it is sometimes slow
6012	I didn't have any problems   ! ! !
6013	I am satisfied most of the time with ABCD.  I just hate being kicked off when im in the middle of something.

6016	Im a senior citizen witha new computor and their help is always available. Im really learning quickly
6017	All on line bussiness was conducted to my satisfaction.
6018	Fast service,pop ups blocked,price is great.

6020	The price is extremely unsatisfing.
6021	everything went smooth
6022	normally i get disconnected many times while on ABCD  but last visit to ABCD was only once I got disconnected
6023	excellent customer service and help with tech support

6029	because everything was according to my expectation.
6030	New computer, newer version, faster and have sound!
6031	YOU ARE SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?????????????, TRYING TO GET IN ON LINE. 
6032	I like all the features ABCD offers, quick and easy
6033	It was quick and easy.  Occasionally it locks up but it worked very well yesterday.
6034	Takes too long to open up pages on the internet, cut offs from the programs happen all time, cant shut down with a ABCD upgrade happening EVERY time I shut down, everything just takes tooooooo long
6035	takes too long for pages to open, the upgrade still happens every time i log out causing an extra 5-10 mintues for that too happen----EVERY TIME i shut down, everything just takes too long in ABCD
6036	i didnt have to wait to get on line
6037	young man was courteous but he still didn't resolve the problem.

6059	"I had no problem getting on; things were very satisfactory and smooth."
6060	It is easy to get to your email and talk to friends thru ims
6061	1)  ABCD is getting buggy again.  I get punted more, mail can't be sent more frequently, stuff just doesn't work.  2)  JUNK EMAIL/SPAM.  I use the spamkiller features on ABCD and stuff STILL gets through.  I report like a psychopath, and stuff STILL gets through.  It's a waste of my time.
6062	ABCD is very reliable - I don't get booted off as I used to

6075	price
6076	price is to high and tried of being nock off line every time pause for a few min to type a letter

6242	I got right on and was able to quickly accomplish what I wanted to do.

6246	"anti-American ""news"""
6247	extreme focus on anti-American issues
6248	i was able to get on look up what i needed and move on

6250	i had no problems
6251	kept getting booted offline not sure if it is a ABCD thing or not.
6252	Got the information I needed in a respectful time and my mail was up very quickly.  Had to delete several trash mailings however.
6253	Was able to access the information that I  needed with relative ease.
6254	Because after spending online got kick off or computer froze up and took a while to get back online as lines where busy.
6255	"I had no problems. Did'nt get ""goodbye"" for no reason like I do occasionally."
6256	the technician was very helpful and really patient and courteous.

6268	Could not get on line easy
6269	To slow getting on line
6270	i was able to look at my employers site with ease
6271	it seems that there are other providers that offer almost all that ABCD offers for half the price.  and what they don't offer, i won't miss.  so, it's more the price
6272	EASE OF SIGN IN, SPEED OF NAVIGATING
6273	no partidular trouble
6274	i was satisfied because i always get what iwant
6275	Because I didn't get any pop-ups like I some times do. Plus I love intsnat messanger

6277	I get kicked off to much and the price,there is to many out there charging only 9.95
6278	it takes no time at all to get from one page to different  site
6279	I could not get it to close off my lap-top for some reason and had to shut my complete syustem down in order to close ABCD!!!
6280	i was able to get online. i was not bumped off either. i use to get bumped off line all the time now i don't
6281	the price. i get charged more to use my checking account then with a credit card. Also i can get dial up service for 9.95. why should i stay with something that cost me more. 28.90 a month. u do the math
6282	got to raed my e-mails
6283	the new pop up controls make researching and wandering around on the net much easier.
6284	I'm just happy with the ease of ABCD
6285	I could get online fast,do what i wanted to do then get off.It is very fast
6286	I got what i wanted
6287	since ABCD has introduced free games, it really keeps me busy having fun!!!especially poppit!!!
6288	Once I managed to get online, it is very to navigate and graphics are sharp/clear.  The system problem remains actually getting online, it is very difficult and generally takes anywhere from 10-45 minutes!
6289	The e-mail on ABCD is user freindly.
6290	Because I didn't have any problems other than the system moving kind of slow.
6291	To much slowness, to many dropped pages can't find or can't connect, the system going out on its own.Need faster service at a better price than they are offering.
6292	I was able to complete my task
6293	had no problems getting online.

6307	I was able to do everything I wanted to online at the time, with no problems.

6480	Could not access websites, got bumped off.
6481	Difficult to access.  Keep getting disconnected while on line.  Too expensive.  Websites not always available.
6482	The customer service is poor. ABCD has too many bugs in it that allow hackers access to your account. ABCD does alot of talk about combatting SPAM but you do not see any results. ABCD lies to it's customers, then increases our rates so they can hire more techs to read from a manual and give scripted answers
6483	because my email box was filled with junk SPAM emails. ABCD claims to be doing something about SPAM but I see no difference. All ABCD did was raise the rates on it's customers and make false claims
6484	I didn't get bumped this time.
6485	accomplished task I wanted to do with the computer.

6492	i didnt get booted and it actually worked for once.
6493	everything was where it was supposed to be. the news was right there, my mail was right there...everything is just very easy to access
6494	ABCD make it easy to find information
6495	problems with opening web pages, so I loged off to see if i went back on, would that make a difference
6496	everything went as expected
6497	The screen stayed on, and I didn't have to reconnect, which ABCD does automatically sometimes.  I don't know why ABCD needs to, but I get a pop-up saying they are.  Most visits don't need it.
6498	had no problems
6499	price increase
6500	ABCD 2.3 IS VERY MUCH IMPROVED. I LIKE THE POP-UP ADS FEATURE VERY MUCH. THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

6517	ABCD would not connect
6518	The informaion I received that I was unaware of.
6519	PLAYED POGO GAMES AND CHATTED IN CHAT ROOM....IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE

6546	It is very easy to use. A lot of quick usefule links available
6547	i didn't get bumped off
6548	I didn't get bumped off
6549	because I didn't have as many pop ups.  Since I have been on this evening I have been bothered by them quite often.
6550	connection was good, information on main page was interesting
6551	didn't have any problems...not too many pop-ups this time

6742	It's just too expensive.  I'm considering switching to one of the cheaper ISP's, such as GGTR, but I really do not wish to do this as I really enjoy ABCD.  But financial circumstances may force me to do so ... unfortunately.
6743	logon time with the online and web-paged

I found the girl that I communicated with online extremely helpful going slow, answering questions and helped me to relax. For a first timer this was difficult

6822	because I came on and did what I wanted to do and the info was there.
6823	it worked
6824	i am only using the service because i have a free month left.  I do not like the type of people on here and the program is boring i can do the same things on my regular internet at a much faster speed and it's totally worth the money, not like the money they charge on here.
6825	I could get on with no problems
6826	got where i needed to go with no problem, found info i needed, with no problem
6827	i was satisfied because everything went smoothly but i still receive extremely to much porn i never ask for it they just send it to me and no matter how much i report it it keeps coming

6831	i was kicked off at least three times
6832	quick easy access to sites
6833	Couldn't get to the sites I wanted, it was too busy.
6834	It is very slow.  Hard to sign on.  Disconnected frequently.
6835	I was finally able to get to my e-mail address and check messages
6836	Gave me important news, lets my voice be heard ( I really like the war meter)
6837	Monthly fee is too expensive. Because it's expensive, I try to gain some money from doing opinion place, but it does not help that much as the guy who told me about it.
6838	ease of use
6839	no connection interuptions
6840	I was able to get the info I needed quick and easy.
6841	Satisfied but occasionally must reconnect or serice on the Internet is slow.

6852	ALWAYS A LOT THINGS THAT SOMEONE IS ASKING ME TO BUY!!  ALWAYS HAVE TO CANCEL MATERIAL IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH  MY GOALS!
6853	SI!
6854	I HAD NO PROBLEMS NO POP UPS I LIKE THAT A SMOOTH VISIT ON LINE WITH NO PROBLEMS
6855	due to the monthly cost i was told to try op to save 9 dollars a month but the most i have saved is 4.00 OR $4.50
6856	I got right on when I needed to.
6857	It was ok.
6858	I was satisfied because I did not lose connection.
6859	Because ABCD kept locking up on me
6860	The visit went smoothly no problems
6861	No down time & everything loaded pretty fast.
6862	ease of use
6863	less offered for amount paid in each month
6864	No waits to get on-line, current new and weather for my area,aable to block spam
6865	Monthly cost in service plan and WABCD always does an illegal operation and I must keep logging on and starting over my imput info on the WEB.
6866	the price and decrease in income
6867	I was able to do what I set out to do - which was only to check for messages, in the case of my last visit.
6868	Everything went well.
6869	Sometimes I get knocked off line and have to keep logging back on.
6870	yes i was satisfied with my last vist
6871	ABCD had get me online with with ease and has all features I need and it controls all the unusfull garbage that comes from any other internet service provider.
6872	I could not get to a site I wanted to. I dont know why , but part of a site was not available that use to be.
6873	We are using other servers at work. It is hard to switch back and forth. It seems to take alot longer to get onto ABCD.Technology is getting faster than I can keep up.I don't have time to get online like I use to. I can't get into sites for some reason.
6874	I have no reason to complain.
6875	the service rep, was honest and helpful
6876	found useful information
6877	I didn't have any problems. Everything was up to snuff.
6878	I kept getting disconnected, but finally got the problem fixed.
6879	I love having unlimited access but I think the monthly price of $23.90 is too high and also ABCD should wave the $5.00 fee of withdrawal from checking account. I think the people who have been ABCD customers for a year or longer should have benefits such as that.
6880	Easy to find the site I was looking for
6881	it is easy
6882	price
6883	"was checking my email and the ""u got pictures"" was awesome! when my cousin send those on her kids!"

6888	dont,knowwww
6889	price
6890	I have always loved ABCD and can't imagine changing.  Everything about it perfect!
6891	do not plan to cancel at all
6892	you are billing me for 2 accts. when I only have one. and you still have not done any thing about it.
6893	Cost
6894	I know what i needed really not the service provider that made me happy
6895	The program keeps crashing and not really compatable with Windows XP Pro. Not great with microsoft programs.
6896	they took time to explain my question with professionalism and great customer care
6897	i found what i needed quickly
6898	i got 2 free months  which is what i asked for
6899	lack of money

6911	I got to the chat that I wanted Mom to Mom without any. hassles at all.
6912	Ease of use.  The only thing that bugs me is the pop ups!!  They are getting more frequent.
6913	Email and search options.
6914	Service and fees.
6915	Difficulty on signing on  Being bumped off too frequently
6916	Was able to get online after two tries.
6917	ease of use
6918	no problems occured. I signed on without a problem, I did not get kicked offline.
6919	took care of promblem
6920	I do not get kicked off as often in the mornings.
6921	No Problems With Anything
6922	Easy to access
6923	i was able to get on and off quickly.
6924	the rate is to high compared to other providers. the dial up connection is much too slow, it takes an average of 2 to 3 dial ups to connect, and I'm thinking of going to my local cable company.
6925	In recieved the information (weather updates) that I was looking for in less than secs...
6926	they took care of my problem.
6927	kept getting pop up notices
6928	too much advertisement

6930	"To many ""errors"" pop up while on ABCD"
6931	because  I  got almost every thing I asked   for
6932	can't aford  it

6940	it was working
6941	cost versus value
6942	I had been having trouble sending my e mail and they gave me some adice on how to fix it.
6943	Price, currently we doEFGH and we pay as much as some people pay for other services.
6944	no problems encountered during my visit
6945	Easy to access
6946	didn't have any cut off from ABCD
6947	quick
6948	On different web sites it had everything I as looking for
6949	move to a different company for service
6950	no problems
6951	"It worked, and did not ""kick me out"" of the service.  I was able to get the work accomplished I needed to do."
6952	I was able to log on quickly and go to the site I wanted to visit faster
6953	finally talked to person who did not argue with me about what I wanted today i was very well informed on all my needs  thanks,,jermery and all others
6954	I was dissatisfied. I has a hard time getting on the address I wanted.
6955	Because the hang time between sites was less than usual.  Overall, 2.3 Plus has been a bust...it is just very slow.
6956	High speed cable access is coming

6965	fast search engine, checked e-mail, checked some favorites, used IM and read some news articles.
6966	got on quick got my info and got off
6967	i was able to send email,with out waiting to send it.i usually get a pop up that says can not deliver mail at this time. so i have to put it in my mail waiting to be sent. and also i get a pop up when i check my mail sometimes, that says unable to display embedded images at this time.
6968	No problems.
6969	the cost
6970	was able to access what I needed
6971	got right on
6972	I enjoy looking at the issues. Only truly dissatisfaction is that using the spam blocker i have to select each one and go through to long of a process for each to block it. Its quicker to delete the spam each day when mail is opened.
6973	Price is to high per month
6974	no comment
6975	normal use of internet, easy to use
6976	because no problems arose
6977	very satisfied, I didn't realize all the pop ups untill i got online with another company and there are pop ups continiously

6983	Easy to use.
6984	i was able to communicate my problem, and the technician was able to help me resolve it.
6985	Well I get Booted off sometimes while checking e mails and being on a websitte at the same time
6986	there didnt seem to be any problems,,, like getting booted or anything. and things seemed to be running quickly.
6987	"There were no problems.  My major complaint has to do with messages stating that ABCD has not responded and/or recent difficulty sending mail; and disconnects which happen too often and are extremely annoying."
6988	to slow,the extra charge for charging it to my phone bill,too many tec problems
6989	no problems looking what iwant
6990	fast connection, fun time
6991	everything worked fine except that it took a very long time to send e-mails today.
6992	Links from the internet get messed up. Downloads from the internet get messed up. If email has a link and is from non ABCD member, the link doesn't work. Also, I would like to link Outlook with ABCD and that's not possible at this time.
6993	There were no problems and I was able to access my email.
6994	Had no problems with use
6995	Customer Service isn't up to par. High monthly fee compared to other ISPs...
6996	I really like the new Mail Controls in 2.3. Plus the cool features in IMs ROCKS!
6997	I was satisfied because response time was good and there were no delays in accomplishing what I needed to do.
6998	I was able to locate the information quick and easy.
6999	checked the incorrect button.  will not be canceling my ABCD
7000	to find out if any other provider equals ABCD's service at a lower monthly price.
7001	ABCD is very expensive compared to other internet providers.  I have had lots of problems with it and often am given the runaround by the tech support folks.  Often I get messages that it is unavailable.  I also have been thrown off.  On occasion, I run into problems visiting certain websites.  Also, sometimes there are problems either opening attachments that I get from others or I hear that they have problems with mine.  It seems that ABCD is not compatible with the rest of the world.  I do not think that it is the best service available for Apple users.
7002	I used to be able to handle MIME attachments when I had Mac OS 9, but now I am unable to do so with Mac OS X.  Also, I ran into security problems with websites. I got messages about certificate problems.  I also got a message that the host was busy.  Things were going very slow, too.
7003	I wasn't on long,I just checked the weather.  It's nice to be able to check the five day forcast online.
7004	cost is the main reason.
7005	I had received alot of information from customer service on how to make ABCD better and to cut costs...helped out alot.
7006	it was easy for me to do what i needed to get done.
7007	"because it""s fast and easy"
7008	because has the information that I need, and always has good news for me.
7009	they tried to address my problem
7010	looked at what i wanted to see
7011	Everything went as expected, there were no surprises.
7012	costs for monthly fees
7013	i knew what i was doing and went straight to it.
7014	easy access to information i requirred, and good on line customer service
7015	No problems encountered.
7016	I was able to stay connected long enough to search for what I wanted to search for.
7017	\\having difficulty staying connectec when I log on line.
7018	ABCD IS JUST EASY TO USE WHENEVER I GET ONLINE.
7019	It was easy to use.
7020	could not get a clear modem signal and i got disconnected 4 times
7021	i was able to do everything i had intended to do with no problems
7022	Because after only being logged on for just a few minutes, I was kicked off.  And like always this happened 2 oter times within a half hour and I got disgusted an signed of for good.
7023	We are constantly being kicked off.  We log on and start doing something and are all of asudden kicked off. This will happen just about every time we log on.
7024	I was able to do what I wanted to do.
7025	The cost is higher than other servers.
7026	it was uneventful of problems...
7027	pop- ups..... i what to go to cable
7028	finance
7029	Less pop-ups and faster thern usual
7030	Slow
7031	no connection problems, and connected at a good speed.
7032	i like ABCD. its very easy t surf and it has a lot of info u can find out
7033	reach ABCD without any wait, did have some spam, i can read and send mail with no problem, get the lastest news
7034	To expensive
7035	served the purpose
7036	ABCD provided easy access to a variety of web sites,email and other information
7037	stock quotes easy and complete
7038	cost
7039	ease of use
7040	i receive emails from a site that ABCD has under bulk senders,and blocks,because they send comics.I get about 10 a day but sometimes the block goes back on the site and had to call ABCD to fix this problem.This morning the emails came with no problem and was also able to download some patches from Microsoft while doing some other things without any problems.
7041	Easy to use
7042	Screen did not lock up, did not get too many pop-up ads, etc
7043	I did not get shut down.  There is something wrong with ABCD and I've had to download it at least 4 times in the past year.  There are bugs still in there.
7044	Ease of use. download speed. no interruptions in service
7045	I had a nice conversation through a chatroom.
7046	Would like to see a change in advertising, popups at inoppertune moments, the flickering images, the repeating sound effects when receiving a personal message that has a sound effect.  Painfully slow to shut off, and restart.  One of the grey popups just came up now.  Very distracting, and unwealcome.
7047	i like the new 2.3 + and i like the new spam features on ABCD communicator
7048	spam, and email system that does not coordinate with pop
7049	i found what i wanted
7050	just the fact that i was able to log onto ABCD without any problems
7051	all of my searches were available to me.
7052	It is always easy to get on. I usually never have a problem.
7053	No problems experienced.
7054	Because I was logged on promptly able to accomplish what I had logged on for with no interuptions.
7055	everything went as planned
7056	customer service
7057	system error.  application went down
7058	Too many ads.

7063	The ease of use of the buddy system

7094	Ease of logging on
7095	ABCD seems to have solved most of its problem with getting connected.  Simetimes to get connected, the telephone numbers would go all the way around and start again with the first number.  Also it is easier to connect with the games that have the largest jackpots.

7097	ABCD CHARGES ALOT MORE THAN OTHER PROVIDERS.

7119	fast access
7120	I am still using .7 as I found when I went from 6 to 7 I was confused and now you are offering .8 and I am not aware of what that level offers however your past changes have  caused delays and excessive upset with inability to use the service/

7130	Because I cant afford it.
7131	I frequent the message boards and run into too mant glutches. Often I'm not able to access them for nearly a day!

7145	Cost too much.
7146	price
7147	Constantly overbilling and refusal to reimburse full amount owed, poor customer service, seldom get english speaking rep.Quality continues on downward slide, In my opinion, they seem to care less and less about customer satisfaction
7148	I just dont have the time
7149	getting disconnected
7150	Increases in rate without notification of patrons
7151	poor quality of sevice & tech. support.
7152	it's insanely expensive and i can get the same thing for $6.50.
7153	price
7154	not only is your server becoming very slow and freezing up alot, but the main reason is because i only have ABCD because of worldplay games.... in which they're closing so i have no use for ABCD anymore, since i have cable connection....also, everytime i call tech or ABCD for anything.....i get people that can't speak english....out of maybe 30 calls.....i've had 2 people speak english
7155	always getting booted off when do i need help i can't understand the techs on the phone lower price
7156	I like ABCD and the services offered.  However, I think the price is a little too high.  Also, I'm concerned about all of the money that ABCD management gives to left-wing organizations.
7157	spams and difficultty with connections
7158	it's hard to get connected online during normal hours of the day and I do a lot of banking and house searches on the computer.  It is important for me to have unlimited access to the internet.
7159	We are moving and will be looking for service with less pop-ups.
7160	you are too epensive and it takes forever to ge signd onto the internet.
7161	broad band service not very good, security issues, too much junk email

7219	"TOO DAMN MUCH SPAM!!!!!!  I'm sick of spending half my online time deleting spam.  ALWAYS the same trash.  There is no excuse for ABCD not being able to filter out ""enlarge your penis"" and ""save money by refinancing"" messages."

7269	I can get unlimited access at a new video store close to my house for only $9.95 per month versus $23.90 I am paying to ABCD.
7270	slow service. 2.3 was suppose to speed things up and what happened was just this oppposite. ABCD cut eliminated us from using another provider. HATE all the ADVERTISEMENTS
7271	Lack of ease getting and reading email.  I can not get mail from many places anymore.  I've spoken to a tech from ABCD and no one knows why I'm having trouble.  I've got a brand new computer.  Doesn't look like I'd have trouble, does it???
7272	I KEEP GETTING KNOCKED OFFLINE....I HAVE ATTEMPTED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY AND SEVERAL TRIES LATER I FINALLY SUCCEED.BUT IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO WASTE SO MUCH TIME TRYING AND TRYING TO DIAL UP AND GET DISCONNECTED
7273	freeze ups and getting booted offline frequentley
7274	because i can
7275	being billed twice as much for the same services I can get elsewhere. I just find the service too expensive for the quality. The only reason I am on right now is due to friends & family being on
7276	Constantly being knocked off the system while in the middle of a project or search
7277	start uy time,plus to many pop up adds
7278	getting kicked off line
7279	speed
7280	Seems we get knocked off a lot
7281	I don't use the internet enough to justify the monthly expense.
7282	"In the middle of something and being shut off(downloading and all of a sudden you hear ""goodbye"". Also, things are too slow at times."
7283	cant afford it and sometimes it is real slow and sometimes i cant do anything cause it want load up all the way
7284	The cost.  I'm not a big fan of all the fancy pretty features.  Takes up a lot of space on my hard drive for things I never use.  I don't need all that, at least not enough to pay the current cost.  Other than the popup blocker and IM, I'd be content with just a straight connection to the internet and nothing else.  I can get another ISP with no frills and be content.  The only reason I have ABCD now is because ABCD takes checks, of course they tack on that extra service fee which upsets me to no end.  I'm over a barrel.  I want my internet and I don't have a credit card.  Lower the cost or offer an unlimited package without bells and whistles at a lower cost and I'd stay with ABCD.
7285	Membership Fee
7286	dial up and download time
7287	It is rip off on the price - $30 per month is too much. It should stay on $9.95 per month. WHy do you need $$?
7288	I would like to change to T1 line.
7289	Cost is excessive compared to other ISP's
7290	that was a mistake i am very satified
7291	May be cheaper alternative
7292	the fact everytime I call customer service they do what u ask then they transfer u to another service trying to sell u something and i thnik that is wrong.
7293	It is not user friendly.  The print function is more complicated than usual because it brings up an ABCD print box instead of the usual print box.  It is slow.  I feel like I rarely get a good speed when I sign on.  The navigation bars for web pages do not work well.  There is so much junk that comes up when I sign on that it takes a long time for it to load.  Past websites that I have entered do not stay on the browser drop down box.  The web address doesn't print on the bottom of the page when I print a web site.  I feel that the service is expensive for what I use it for.
7294	Cost.
7295	I keep getting kicked of-line while trying to do anything.  If I am surfing, researching materials for my Master's degree, while sitting in class chats, while downloading software for classes.  Boom!  No warning - just bumped off.  I have done the repair the global.org file ten times in ten weeks.  I have to re-boot computer because all my applications stop responding.  I can tell you how many research hours I have lost on papers and on programming (scripting).
7296	There are cheaper rates with other companies
7297	I may be moving
7298	Cost primarily, secondly connection issues, phone line or system doesn't support fast internet, might as well use cheapest available.
7299	"I have had trouble with email not being sent in a timely fashion and not reaching the recipient at all, despite being shown as ""sent.""  In addition, access to the message boards is often interrupted.  I don't feel as though ABCD is any bargain and I resent having to pay the full fee and not get the full service."
7300	2.3 is slow.  Have cable modem.
7301	too expensive
7302	poor custemer service, better deals with other ip's, too expesive
7303	monthly fee
7304	Too expensive!!!
7305	because of other ABCD members I've talked to who have tried to cancell their membership, because of high cost, but their bank account was still debited for the amount of the service and they were not reinburst for the amount.So at the end of my free trial, I will cancell mine before my account is debited also.
7306	COST COST COST
7307	will be not needing service for around 3 months
7308	They tell me one thing and mean another
7309	cost

7311	Too many problems with the ABCD network
7312	trouble loggin on, and getting knocked off
7313	dont really like some of the new features and price
7314	I use the internet through work, not much at home. Not enough to warrant $15 a month.

7316	I am always booted off when I am playing games.
7317	Price mainly
7318	cost
7319	Company is creating internal website and will be supplying email addresses for all employees.

7322	Too expensive for a dial-up service.
7323	customer sevice responses and less expensive providers for similar service
7324	spam and expensive
7325	look for better service
7326	all these ABCD differnet networks always take money out of my account
7327	because of the cost
7328	what you charge.   I pay less for cable TV
7329	because i can get internet service for half the money that i pay for ABCD now.
7330	i am a Hemodialysis patient, and I am not working at the moment , so it will be hard for me to pay for the ABCD internet service
7331	monthy price is higher than i think it should be for basic internet service. I dont chat or use many of the other features. I just use the world wide web.
7332	price
7333	price & i hate pop ups
7334	I am seeking high-speed access at a resonable price, and ABCD does not offer competitive rates.
7335	High Speed Connection

7363	none....I selected the wrong choice. I am not likely to cancel
7364	ABCD is frequently slow, IM is often inaccessible
7365	Reporting spam does not work as they say, and i really can't stand how i am unable to close my main menu, instead it minimizes, HUGE pet-peave, it's the only window box that doesn't close, why even have the X as an option?
7366	thinking about going to cable
7367	Mistake on the last page...I will NOT cancel!!!
7368	I think that the price is too high.
7369	Incompatibility issues that were not addressed adiquatly before installation and deamage to operating system that required complete reload. Hav had serious lag problems after intense fix session and numerous calls to tech support, and customer service. Also lack of response to alets provided by me about abuses of system by others and the unauthorized use of my screen name by unknown individuals.
7370	too expensive for checking just mail
7371	Son using it for the wrong things
7372	Bad service, disconnections very frequent, Acct. mess-ups
7373	The cost is higher than other services, with little meaningful difference in content.
7374	unable to sign on in a timley manner
7375	I do not have a job so I will have to cut costs down.
7376	Being nocked off line.
7377	ABCD Techs read from a book - u call 6 different times regarding the same problem and get 6 different responses!!!ABCD made a big mistake with teh 2.3 version they should have told consumers it was not appropriate for all comuputers.   It led to numerous problems and a good deal of expence for me and MANY other users.   DO U WANT MORE?
7378	price
7379	I can not see why I have to put up with constantly losing a connection, it gets most aggravating, i have friends on other ISPs that do not go through what I do with their connections

7381	Cannot get connected and is slow when online and get kicked off way too often.

7388	boring content. no need for it.
7389	too costly
7390	Slow. failure to provide new mac versions for people who cant afford a new computer with Os X. Annoying webcam porn IMs Slow service. Not adding new Acess numbers SPAM.I dont like the ads in chatrooms for other ABCD chatrooms. If im in a chat for dating etc. I dont want the ABCD what are people talking about current events ads. That is annoying and one less space for a person who wants to chat.

7404	EVERY SINCE I WENT TO 2.3 I GET TONS OF SPAM - EVERY TIME I CHECK THE MAIL THERE ARE SEVERAL SPAM MESSAGES - I SEND AND BLOCK BUT I JUST KEEP GETTING MORE.  I AM ON A LIMITED PLAN AND IT TAKES ME A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT TIME EVERY DAY JUST TO GET RID OF THE SPAM
7405	Incredibly long time in getting connected. Get disconnected often. Too many popups.Biggest reason is delays.
7406	poor response to questions via tech support, being disconnected repeatedly, ABCD programming crashing daily
7407	very unlikely
7408	slow connections and high prices
7409	The cost is getting out of control. The service is not all that good. There are so many other ISP's out there who give unlimited use for around $10 a month.
7410	ABCD does not support older Mac computers.  Also there is too much spam, especially when I set up a Member Profile.  I would also like to be able to go online at a faster speed than 56K.
7411	loss of worldplay games
7412	Spam Mail, Software has a lot of conflicts with windows. Security concerns.
7413	Can't aford membership fees
7414	constantly getting disconnected.trying to run a business on e-bay and its slow and very frustrating

7422	it is too expensive every month and there is too many users of ABCD therefore it takes forever to get on a sight
7423	The price has gone up too much.
7424	Cost
7425	i want to get away from dial up, cancel my extra phone line which would save me some money.
7426	i keep trying to go for the $4.50 reward with the op and get the $2.50 reward although I was told I can get up to two $4.50 per month and it never works. for this reason you are misleading us and it makes me angy. i have been with you for many many years....and this  is misleading your members.
7427	too expensive
7428	I can't afford it.
7429	too many service interruptions can't get online sometimes
7430	Spam, pop-ups
7431	not thrilled considering how much we spend on service
7432	In comparison to other providers, ABCD is much more expensive.
7433	can not aford it
7434	Inconsistent ability to sign on due to all local access numbers apparently being busy. And the fact that I get knocked off line while doing tasks that cannot be started again in the middle, such as completing my LCSW (social work) CEU credit exams.  Lately, emails have not been delivering in a timely fashion
7435	Not always satisfying services
7436	"1. CONSTANT ""POP-UP"" WINDOWS...VERY ANNOYING! 2. VERY POOR ABILITY TO CONTACT ANYONE FOR CORRECTIONS OR COMMUNICATIONS, BY TELEPHONE."
7437	Too Expensive/frequent server disconnects/not enough server bandwidth causing slow surfing during prime time
7438	Rate
7439	Spam, bad service, prizes not all given to expensive
7440	THERE ARE CHEAPER ON LINE SERVICES. I MAY TRY ONE.
7441	The last month or so, I get kicked off a lot!!  Also, the price is too high for the service I get.
7442	The price is to high.
7443	have no reason to cancel
7444	I tried 2.3 and it freezes.
7445	The main reason would be the monthly cost.  
7446	have modem
7447	your broad band rate are awfull... 
7448	unwanted spam is a problem
7449	price
7450	price is too high

7462	All that junk mail.  I keep either deleting them or report spam.  There are too many of them that it is very depressing.
7463	I used free tial and before the trial period is over, i called to cancel the free trial and rep granted me extension of free services and to my surprise i was billed and when i called ABCD said that you never called. Very frastrusted customer for wrongly billing. I remember talking to Thomas from Jacksonville,fl and he granted me extension till April 25th. I called again to cancel and talked to Margie. She grant me extension till May 26 but there is no call log in your database for extension till 25th April. First time in the history of my mebmership since 1996 I had a very bad experience about ABCD.
7464	cost of high speed internet and ABCD not worth having both
7465	ABCD IS ALLWAYS DROPING WHEN YOU ARE ONLINE
7466	I have been using the ABCD free CD's and my time is up in July because,  I do not have job at this time to continue paying for the usage.
7467	I am currently on a contract with ABCD until 10/03 and once that contract is up I plan on finding a company that is cheaper and offers faster connection to the internet the connection speed thru ABCD is the worst in our area If I connect using another ISP I will connect at 56k vs 28k
7468	can not afford it
7469	BEING CHARGED $5.00 EXTRA TO PAY FOR MY MEMBERSHIP WITH MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND JUST THE PRICE IT IS TO HAVE UNLIMITED SERVICE. IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE THE BEST SERVICE TO ME BUT YHAT IS KNOW REASON TO CHARGE THE HIGHEST PRICE
7470	New programs don't work well.  8.o  keeps freezing even after I have tried all remedies ABCD tells me to do
7471	finances due to divorce

7476	I MEANT TO HIT NOT LIKELY AND NOT LIKELY.
7477	The price, I dont think it is worth the money anymore. I can find 90% of the content free on the internet so the value proposition isnt there anymore

7479	unable to sign on due to heavy traffic,Getting kicked off while on line, very slow responce time
7480	It is getting more expesive, I have to use my phone line and on some days it bumps me out of the net for no reason(sometimes 2 or 3 times on one nite)

7488	Looking for lower prices per month
7489	billing problems   such as hitting my acccout with  double payments
7490	I am looking for security in a browser.  I had heard that ABCD had problems keeping personal info away from hackers.
7491	The constant sexual harrassment of other members. I have been forced not to use the chat feature because of this. One member has actually gone so far to constantly monitor my chat activities and report me for everything I say. Making it so I get TOSed every day and threatened to lose my account.
7492	filth filth filth spam spam spam..no policing of chatroom foul language in chatrooms..daily filth mail..
7493	the rate per month is higher than other online services i have been looking at
7494	The price. ABCD should do price differentiation. For example student discount for those people that is doing graduate studies. I found that ABCD version 8 is slow compared to the previous version.  Many adds appears suddlenly.
7495	Crash of my ABCD system, which caused me to lose four months of business email. Inability of ABCD staff to help me.
7496	None

7509	CAUSE I CAN GET CHEAPER SERVICE.
7510	i now have a cable modem and i dont want to pay for two internet services i love ABCD and if it was close to the same price as my cable modem i would go with them but its a lot cheaper for me to go with the cable modem and it doesnt take up my phone line
7511	I have a cable connection and ABCD is an unecessary expense.
7512	SHOPPING FOR OTHER SEVICE
7513	Husband has been laid off from work. Do not have the funds  for internet service right now
7514	I accidently first clicked on very likely to cancel, but that was an error ...I do not intend to cancel
7515	conection problems, slow
7516	Not enough income.
7517	to get optimion on line
7518	i think ABCD is to user friendly
7519	too expensive
7520	I think that there may be ISPs that provide similar service at a less expensive cost.  Also, I pay by credit card and would prefer a monthly bill at home.  Also, I do not like the pop advertisements.
7521	the monthly fee is too much
7522	ABCD was able to customize the service for me & my usage.
7523	lost of income
7524	We possibly might need more time for less money
7525	Problems with dailup service no one could fix so they kept giving me free time which does me no good when you can't get online for more than 3 or 4 mins.
7526	due to the extra charge being that i don't have a credit card and funds need to be drafted via debit card
7527	better rates for unlimited service
7528	I'm not doing much on ABCD anymore Find other things to do with my time.
7529	cost, service ( busy, cut-offs)
7530	they are constantly updating the system and when they are doing this it always affects the performance of my online experience causing extreme delays, getting booted, etc.
7531	I put the 2.3 on the computer and now it seems to be full of ads, and junk when I sign on.
7532	monthly payment is high.
7533	cost
7534	too many porn sites in chat rooms, slow service, being disconnected for no reason, server taking too long to connect to a site i want to go
7535	the price for having it taken out of the checking account is as much as we pay for EFGH internet.  so i might just save that money every month
7536	TOO EXPENSIVE
7537	price
7538	I have direct cable service not requiring an isp, daughter is older not requiring parental controls
7539	too expensive
7540	Problems with switcching my account billing to check as opposed to debit card (which cost me an extra 20.00). Customer service issues and billing issues.
7541	there are cheaper rates out there
7542	the cost is more than it should be
7543	it goes to slow when connect, and it cost more then others don't see a differents
7544	Cheaper rate Telephone direct connection
7545	Cost and that switching to cable internet would run faster
7546	WAY TOO MUCH SPAM!
7547	Too Expensive
7548	because its not what used to be with ABCD helpdesk or the tech support!
7549	I have compared the price with other options, and find that although your services are superior, I have an option of another ISP at a better value.  But I am very disatified with the local phone company, who is an ISP, with a $19.95 rate, and will not let another ISP serve the area, unless they charge more than $19.95 /month.  Therefore I am going to a service provided through my satellite dish.  Also, you have refused to put in an access number for Concord--- My access is through Kannapolis, N. C.
7550	hard to connect
7551	Keep geting knocked off
7552	Budgetary concerns
7553	A definite lack of respect & consideration on the part of arrogant,uncaring & definitely unhelpfull representatives in your customer service dept.If they would just operate in good faith,make a good faith effort & merely choose to be a part of the solution instead of part of the problem...then ABCD would not have a problem...All they need to do is show they care a little @ fixing the problem & not add insult to injury by inappropiate comments.
7554	I was incorrectly billed....and the customer service rep wasn't helpful,....I was handed off to several different people and had to explain to situation all over again...
7555	not that good online
7556	Pop ups coming up even though I have them blocked
7557	Costs.. too many porn emails...
7558	too many problems with ABCD
7559	I may choose to subscribe to a cable internet provider.
7560	It is to expensive
7561	I do not like the extra features because it slows my system down when logging off
7562	on strick budgetfor health reason ,medication to high so i like ABCD. but i will be letting it go soon.
7563	Have ZDT cable internet and use the ABCD through it with EFGH.  Don't need two internet providers.
7564	Financial
7565	I KEEP GETTING BUMPED OFF AND MY SYSTEMS FREEZES UP ON A REGULAR BASIS.
7566	The price is higher than the other companies providing the same service.
7567	ACCESS FEE HIGHER
7568	price competition and comparison
7569	made error. plan to stay witk ABCD
7570	Because I have cable connection and paying the extra 14.95 a month for ABCD is just rediculous.
7571	interruptions, of service, email
7572	to expensive
7573	To much money
7574	have cable modem and have my own e-mail set up etc
7575	keep geeting errors while on the web
7576	Try to get something less expensive
7577	i get booted off constently sometimes it will reconnect me but mostly not.
7578	Other companies that provide service for much less money.
7579	I'm sick and tierd of all the pop ups and continuous interruptions when I'm on line.
7580	Very slow and takes a great deal of time logging on and going to web pages.
7581	"Cost per month.  Was told when tried to cancel that I could get ABCD for $15.95/mo; however, wasn't explained that it takes so much time to ""earn"" Credits that don't even bring the Cost down to $15.95."
7582	looking for a cheaper deal
7583	The price
7584	Getting access to the internet.  Also that_____ ABCD uses to greet and tell you good-by.  seems to delight when he can hang up on you.  comes across very cold
7585	cost
7586	I have another Free Connection through work
7587	It's too expensive.
7588	Looking for cheaper service
7589	When I went to OptimumOnline with my cable company I was quoted $9.95 price after free months keeping ABCD and when the free time was over the price was $14.95. I may eventually give up my cable internet but am disappointed with ABCD for not sticking to the bargain. I am trying to decide what to do now.
7590	system goes down or loses connections more than 10 times a day. probably because of call wave. didn't have problem until they installed 2.3 . since ABCD changed system not to be compatable with call wave, and force us to use there call system we beleve it is there fault, they started it so we will be moving on to another service. for what it is worth we are not the only ones going to leave ABCD. many people are upset over it.
7591	expensive to have a cable modem and an ABCD subscription
7592	Dishonesty, price increases

I am a Kindergarten teacher, and my students parents have my screen name to e-mail me, and if they ever got oneo of those mailings and recognized my screen name, I could be in danger of losing my job!  If it happens a third time I will definately be leaving ABCD

7626	because of bad service
7627	It is annoying and time consuming to have to resign on to ABCD because it either doesn't recognize my sign on or it is very unstable and unreliable, also the cost is way too much for the lack of service that I get.
7628	Monthly membership fees
7629	It tends to throw me out or freez when I am in the middle of impotant things causing me to log back into the system and begin all over again
7630	too expensive,
7631	because of the money

Then, when I get a live person, (s)he is either: rude and surly or not knowledgable, or has told me how to fix a problem and it didn't fix it.  The reason I stayed with ABCD for so long was that always before, a live person was helpful, polite and PATIENT with me.

My credit card company will not continue to reverse charges so I am having to cancel my card or finally get ABCD to do something. ABCD has until June to fix this problem before I begin weighing my options.  I enjoy ABCD and all the friends I have made but this is a HUGE problem for me...please...consider my opinion important and don't give the email to the trash...HELP!!!!!!!

7808	The cost is high compared to others. Also, other people that have ABCD pay different amounts for their service. Many lower than us.
7809	ABCD's mail is not as good as XXVD or hot mail.  Users have very limited ability to set the junk mail filter.
7810	The frustration with the problem I encountered 2 wks. ago with SIMPLY trying to downgrade the time usage and upgrade from 2.5.  My reference # is 107591374.--- As we can ALL see--- the problem was NOT my cd rom.
7811	I get booted a lot, and the price.
7812	connection is terrible. i get getting kicked off at home. whenever i use my same laptop from another location i do not get knocked off and it is much faster.

7824	I feel that it takes too long to sign on and too long to get information and I don't like all the pop ups and ad on line I feel anyone could get all my information not secured
7825	Its slow.
7826	Cost
7827	Problem with entering secure websites. Also freezes up.
7828	The connections are slow, too many pop ups even with the blocker.  I can speedband for half the price, no voice chat, and no web cam options.
7829	Price cheaper elseware 14.95
7830	Too expensive
7831	It's expensive, and I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth - the most annoying thing, is those ads for all those services ABCD is trying to sell (who cares??? let me see my email! let me sign off when I want to!), but there are also disconnection of the line at times, the browswer is annoying, receiving attachments on ABCD is particularly annoying - I'd much rather use Outlook for my mail, and honestly, I the Explorer is a better browswer. But most of all - stop trying to get us to spend more money all the time! especially when there are so many internet providers out there, and most of them cheaper than ABCD. I will probably cancel before next billing date.
7832	Cost
7833	When you call them for help or services there is always a long wait and way to many automated choices before they come on the  line and tell you that they are too busy to answer your call and please try again later.
7834	I don't plan to cancel. I accidentally clicked on the wrong button and this page doesn't allow me to go backwards.
7835	Doesn't do anything of extra value for me daily.
7836	Price is the main reason, followed by SPAM
7837	cost

7839	Broad band trial was a disgrace. Never got a minute of service but have been charged for 2 months service
7840	cost is too high.
7841	The cost is high for what I use ABCD for. I can get it cheaper on another server for much less.
7842	too expensive
7843	The price is a bit high and I loose connection easy , a lot of my family is going with other isp like XXVD, CGTR and PPSTU
7844	Cost of service in addition to Cable Access charges
7845	cost
7846	Cost
7847	As a student it is difficult for me to afford the payments.  Additionally, with dial up service, ABCD is slow.  Lastly, my account has been tampered with and I have been getting strange messages from people whom I do not know.
7848	it isnot that exciting any more lack of interest
7849	too expensive
7850	"I have purchased cable access through my local cable company as ABCD was pirating my system and was constantly shutting down my computer and timing out or ""performing an illegal function"", etc."
7851	cause ABCD feezes up my computer, and it also cuts u off in the middle of a game, reading email, chatting
7852	"because every time i get a free trial, i am charged a monthly fee and this has happened to me three times already; i have saved at least one email stating that my time free for ABCD is until june but i was charged last month; again, i am stating this is not the first time this has happened;"
7853	Well, i have a cable modem and i didn't know about dial up charges when my modem went down.  So i used dial up a lot and went over my monthly limit.  The people were nice, but they didn't help me out when i asked them to.
7854	COST
7855	price
7856	to get a faster service and a service that more effectively blocks spam.
7857	When I sign on I cannot get in on certain times of the day and that is upsetting.
7858	There are many more ISP's to choose from these days and the cost of other's is so much cheaper than ABCD.  They all give about the same service so that would be a reason for me to switch.
7859	It is the most expensive. I use ABCD for pleasure. I have been making cuts in every area of my budget that I can.
7860	prblems w/billindinfo,tech support spoke very poor english,disconnected constantly on dail up,customer service
7861	It is much more expensive than other Internet Service Providers.  Also the same services are offered from other providers at a cheaper price.
7862	cheaper rates avaiable

7869	I think the price is a little much
7870	financial reasons.  I think it is a little bit too expensive compared to come other companies.
7871	Cost
7872	because my computer is always freezing and several of my freinds have the same proglem with ABCD. and when i call for   help nobdy efer can help
7873	too much compared to other offers
7874	hi speed internet access
7875	financial reasons
7876	finacial,speed,use
7877	Amount of spam I continually receive even though I have tried to set limits on incoming mail.  Also we now have a cable service which is more efficient.
7878	The cost. I can get unlimited time for 9.94 a month compared to 23.90. I wouldn't have to worry about keeping track of my time online and worry about going over.
7879	My husband thinks $23.90 per month is too expensive for dial up internet service.  Also, this download box keeps popping up that says I have chosen to some ABCD payment or something.  It's driving me crazy!
7880	compatibility problems
7881	dis-connects,price
7882	will not cancel
7883	SPAM, Being knocked off of line alot
7884	My kids feel it is too costly and they could find me a better service and price elswhere

7886	the expense, probably going to cable modem
7887	high speed internet connection
7888	always get booted off saying that ABCD did an illegal action
7889	the price. ABCD is wonderful but a little exspensive if you don't get on line a lot
7890	The cost is too high for the little I use it.  There is not sufficient information on lesser cost programs.
7891	Not likely to cancel at all.
7892	Cost of service as compared to other ISPs.
7893	Currently unemployed and can't afford the regular monthly fee.
7894	SOME PROBLEMS I HAD WITH TECH SUPPORT THEY DIDNT SEEM VERY EAGER TO TRY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM THEY HAD MADE WORSE.INSTEAD HAVING ME CALL MICROSOFT
7895	its too  much  garbeage  (bells and whistles)  not enough speed
7896	SLOW TO CONNECT, POOR CONNECTIONS, GET BOOTED  OR LOCKING UP OFTEN
7897	I usually use it only to read my e-mails. So it's not worth me paying 23+ dollars a month.
7898	Pop up ads
7899	As little as I use it & the cost of it monthly
7900	I dont need it as my primary ISP any longer as I have gone with a cable internet hook up.
7901	Expensive Too many popups Too many ads
7902	bad cable
7903	The Cost of ABCD and That I don't have the money because of other expences that I have to come up with.
7904	I am tired of not being able to open anything people send me.  A box always appears and tells me that it is too big for ABCD to open.  In some cases it is a one page list and in others it will be pictures.
7905	poor services
7906	price
7907	no money
7908	Poor customer service

7910	price
7911	price
7912	price
7913	main reason for cancelation will be price, i can get other services for cheaper prices, plus you dont get all the pop ups.  getting booted is a bummer also, almost every day I am booted off after being on here about 20 or 30 minutes.
7914	I almost had to cancel today because of financial reasons, but a very nice lady helped me out and gave me 2 awards from the Awards center.  I am currently looking for a new job so I can keep my ABCD service.
7915	Constantly being kicked off and all the pop up advertising
7916	can not afford to keep it right now
7917	cost to much. and thay overcharged me on my acount and it was hard to fix
7918	Cost of service compared to free service from other providers

7925	the price of ABCD is higher then compeditors
7926	keeps dropping off line
7927	I'm broke.
7928	The only reason I am going to cancel is the price.
7929	better deals for limitted usage
7930	Your unlimited service is too expensive. I can get the same thing, but with another isp
7931	Lack of sufficient funds.
7932	The price is outrageous for something so easy to obtain at a MUCH lower price.
7933	they are constantly messing up my billing.

7954	I will be going to cable.  There are other companies offering a lot cheaper rates than ABCD.
7955	expensive
7956	financial reasons.  Possible job lay-off.
7957	Price
7958	Because the rates are extremely rediculous!
7959	I have a hacker and it don't seem to be getting any better
7960	because of my employment status, financial reasons
7961	I will likely to cancel my ABCD membership because I go to school and I don't really have a steady job to be able to pay an internet service. I have already an access to free internet at school since that is where I spend most of my time.
7962	this is a trial membership
7963	too expensive for EFGH
7964	may switch to cable internet
7965	Advertising on the message boards, up in the right hand corner.

7969	I want  hig speed internet.  And the cost is to high
7970	It's too expensive for what little I use it.

7982	Cost, I'm on a fixed income and would appreciate a disability discount...
7983	Service is frequently interrupted.  Cost is higher than others.
7984	money
7985	because I am not on the internet enough to spend 24.95 a month for unlimited, and I use it more than 2 hours for the price of 12.95, and then paying .99 extra for an additional hour so if you want to give me unlimited for 12.95 a month I will stay....
7986	I am fed up with ABCD's failure to screen spam.
7987	price
7988	I have XXVD as my home page at work and I think there is more offered...I have some response issues with ABCD.

7993	PRICE
7994	The primary reason I subscribed to ABCD was for the decent set of parental controls. Since there are no longer any children in the house and I am a subscriber to another ISP, ABCD is redundancy.
7995	software seems to mess up all of my computers,slows them down and disconnects
7996	there is way too much spam
7997	it cost to much and we are moving
7998	Will not change from ABCD......ever!!

8002	really want something faster
8003	i don't intend to cancel.

8005	The price is too high!
8006	Too Expensive
8007	Too much junk email
8008	i am not planning on cancelling ABCD.
8009	Chatrooms are being controlled the wrong way, you get tossed for saying the smallest wrong thing...people abuse the rights for being ''the owners of the chat rooms.''
8010	PRICE
8011	The rates are to high for unlimited access, but yet some people get it for 14.95 per month.   Why isn't that offered to everyone? Instead most people are charged 23.90 per month.   Way too high.   Other companies offer better prices.
8012	Cost
8013	none
8014	Unable to get high speed internet through ABCD.

Im not very happy that I canceled each of them 3 or 4 times and I am still getting charged for them.And in the past 2 months 7 checks out of my bank account has bounced!!  It pisses me off, and when I call to talk to a ABCD representative about it the are absolutly RUDE!  I would NEVER recommend ABCD to anyone.
8019	Spam is totally out of control.  Price--I can get unlimited access for less than I am paying for 20 hours.  I have tried to get 20 hours for $10 from ABCD, but no one at ABCD will give me this price. That's why I am participating in the Opinion Place.
8020	The cost. We are in the process of retiring and there are other internet svc. that cost a lot less.
8021	Cost
8022	I always am getting knocked off.
8023	Do not use the benefits often enough.
8024	they are not flexible, will not change payment due date
8025	I was injured in an automobile accident that was not my fault. I may be too far behind with my bills to sustain use on ABCD.
8026	COST FOR SERVICE OTHER COMPANIES ARE CHARGING MUCH LESS
8027	all the advertising that pops up when u are online. u are looking something up then a request for an im comes up and your window u are looking at goes small.
8028	better service somewhere else, where I'm moving to
8029	cheeper with other providers
8030	To slow, Money
8031	To obtain cheaper service. 
8032	Because these pop up that ABCD have cause my computer to miss up. When it get like 3 or more pop up, my computer will freeze up and everything will close down and it miss up alot of work and we miss out on alot of money cause ABCD
8033	monthly cost
8034	I have lost my job.

8043	The pop ups and e-mails.    I have since gone to a different route with banning e-mails - but nothing worked when contacting ABCD about the problem.  I finally had to customize everyone's name who I wanted to receive e-mails from and this has been my best solution so far.   The others just did not work - but doing it my way was very tedious and there should be an easier way.    I omitted some names and could have had hard feelings over omitting their names - but like I said, this was the best solution for me.
8044	The monthly fee is rather high.
8045	I will not used the internet as much.

8136	The pricing is just too much you can most of the same stuff for 20 dollars less. and lately the you can hardly get on any way.
8137	I am continually getting kicked off line. I think that after the raise in rates - there has been NO benefit to me.
8138	cost
8139	Prices, and Junk mail
8140	Cost
8141	high price
8142	poor service  inability to connect when outside the country
8143	The price, I am going with a cable connection that comes with cable television for about $40 per month.
8144	Better offer by a competitor
8145	Pricing
8146	Financial Distress
8147	cost
8148	Lower price from other providers
8149	slow service, constant problems connecting, junk mail, and someone used my account and its price
8150	freez ups,  cut offs
8151	"I can count on being booted off the network at least once during a visit; after that one or two times, I am usually OK"
8152	Because When I get ABCD for free it runs fine. Then when I am paying for ABCD It kicks me off constantly
8153	"The service is getting worse, too many times getting kicked off and the price keeps going up.  Half of the time I can't get anything open, says the system is ""down"""
8154	I have to look at the different companies to decide which would serve us the best.
8155	moving due to a job wont be needing the service any longer
8156	"bad connections and ABCD ""kicking me off"" while online."
8157	Other internet service providers that are less expensive.
8158	want faster
8159	1.  All the spam drives me nuts.  2.  Often getting a message that shuts me down.  3.  Long connection time.
8160	the cost
8161	Service charge is too high customer service reps are not friendly
8162	ABCD will kick me off and lockup my computer
8163	the only way i would cancel ABCD is if my computer breaks down and i can't afford to get it fixed or purchase a new one
8164	moved to a town that does not have a local number to dial up too.
8165	found a cheaper iternet service with the same options for much less
8166	The cost per month.
8167	I have had nothing but problems with it,I went to the live help so many times I am tired of being on my computer to always going to help sights!!!!!!
8168	I have another provider
8169	Going to get a cable modem.
8170	Cannot afford
8171	cost to much
8172	Cause I am a cheap bastard, and like things free.
8173	cheaper service provider
8174	I am not likely to cancel my membership
8175	Expense of service.
8176	I am constantly getting kicked off.  Even though ABCD 2.3 is set up to automatically reconnect - if I or a member of my family is in the middle of a game, upon reconnection you are not able to return to the place in the game where you left off.  This can be extremely frustrating for a five  year old and the adult who has to deal with the situation.  I am also dissatisfied with the inability of 2.3 to deal with spam.  I have had other internet services where you can just click on a button to block a particular email address, whereas with ABCD there  are several steps  that you must go through in order to accomplish this.
8177	Quality of service.
8178	Cheaper ISP rates by other ISP providers
8179	SPEED
8180	cost more than GGTR which im switching to.
8181	cost
8182	I am retired and can get it cheaper from another Online service.
8183	too expensive and rude customer service reps
8184	Poor Customer Service, too many disconnects, too slow
8185	STUPIDITY
8186	For some reason ABCD has been taking out money from my account before my payment is due and twice a month and plus I feel it is too exspensive especially to people who have been loyal members for so long!
8187	relocation
8188	price---being retired means cutting back on some things--talked to a counselor at ABCD and suggested I could save money this way----thought I would try for a couple of months and see-----am looking into wmconnect
8189	BECAUSE MY HUSBAND FIND SOMETHING BETTER.
8190	cost is inflated
8191	slow download, to many pop up windows
8192	VACATION
8193	Price
8194	Being knocked off sys while on-line......To many pop-ups
8195	to many popups even with the filter and tomuch spam
8196	Completely a cost issue...it's a competitive market... the same service for almost half the cost.
8197	May not be able to continue to pay for the services.
8198	it cost to much money
8199	cheaper provider
8200	Financial reason, at this time im unemployed.
8201	Cost
8202	to expensive
8203	i had a prblem with billing i am glad they were able to give  me free months but when i could not afford it and tried to cancel they gave me free months and then charged my checking account and i  bounced checks when they said they would put the  money in the bank it never got there  when i called about it the man was EXTREMELY RUDE.
8204	customer service seems to mess up alot.
8205	server not available slow price
8206	They let to many Spam e-mails offering Sex and Drugs to young people and the general public thru.  I find much of the SPam we receive to be very offensive.  Not everyone is a balding, limp, broke junkie.
8207	membership fee!
8208	to slow--can't get on line-- get knocked of line
8209	the rates
8210	2.3 has to many kinks that still need to be worked out. It take mutiple times to log on before i can you the internet.
8211	cheaper prices
8212	TOO MUCH MONEY,CAN GET CHEAPER SERVICE THAT DO SAME THING
8213	completely disatisfied with your service. 
8214	they do not help you in any way of tec.suport and the rate is to high
8215	I get booted too often, lots of pop up garbage, too much loss in programs from ABCD,also, billing was a major issue a couple months ago, due to someone other than orselves, changed billing and we had to pay an ourtageoug mount.  
8216	trying to save money
8217	I use a cable internet provider and can't afford the additional $9 a month for the ABCD service.
8218	high price
8219	Cost of service.
8220	Job situation
8221	annoying phone help
8222	i have had problems with the ABCD billing system and its starting to lag alot

8225	Price
8226	OUT OF WORK
8227	price
8228	Constant disconnections and bad connections
8229	I use ABCD because I travel a lot {6 to 7 months a year}with long stays in Las Vegas and Palm Desert. The phone modem service at both of those locations has gotten so poor that I am considering changing provider.
8230	other companies offering lower price for internet connection.....for those of us who dont use all of the chatrooms, etc.
8231	possibly going with a different local high speed provider that also offers phone and television cable service.
8232	"cons.service help(over the phone)does know how to help;problems with connection(pc, mac)"
8233	cost of service. I am on a limited income
8234	i found a cheaper company, also i called to cancel so they gave me 3 months free and i still got charged for this month because the customer service failed to inform me of information i needed to collect my rewards!  to expensive!!!!

8249	taking so long to send mail,no buddy list,but their working on it ,yeah right. some embbeded mess. wont open.too long to upload.having lots of problems with ABCD since the frist of year.
8250	Technical problems, lack of concern from customer service when I call in about problems.  I get no response when I call in, just free time offered to me. Free time doesnt help me make my ABCD work on a regular basis.  I also recieve no feedback when I comment at kw tell us.
8251	It's too expensive to keep and their rate keeps increasing
8252	to expensive
8253	have trouble connecting to ABCD
8254	i dont have no reason to cancell, i dont know if i will maybe the rates
8255	"service is slow, often get ""kicked off"" of the internet"
8256	slow connections and numerous disconnects and reconnects

8260	husband wants to go to broad band they have it for $19.00 for 6 months
8261	I have cable modem ABCD freezes up too much
8262	We will be moving out of USA, hope other country, Dominican Republican has ABCD service provider in there.
8263	too expensive
8264	We have new internet service with our cable company and I do not want to pay for two services.
8265	it is too expensive and i cannot afford it

8281	lack of use on my part
8282	Billing problems
8283	It conflicts with my cablemodem software, I am always getting error messages on ABCD about internet script errors
8284	Pop up ads, and the porno e-mails
8285	I am using a cable modem, and can not justify the cost for both services.
8286	cheaper inter net
8287	I think that I could find something a little cheaper
8288	Price, cluttered main page, unwanted ABCD offers
8289	the price is to high.  other ones have unlimited for $9.95.
8290	I have a cable connection-it is expensive to keep ABCD
8291	Too much advertising.  Too many pop-ups.  Too slow.
8292	Don't offer virus protection And payment for dial up is too much.
8293	Too much unsolicitated mail and too many intrusive pop up ads.
8294	it is to expensive there are many more far isp providers for less
8295	Due to the rising monthly cost $23.95.  I had enrolled when ABCD was 9.95 a month.  I will be seeking faster download speed service that cost 3 to 4 dollars more than your monthly rate.
8296	error messages many times daily that knock me offline and your techs are imcompetent and in 3 years have not been able to help me with problem. I can't enjoy my online time for getting kicked off several times in one sitting especially when I have long email  just typed out or something important fixing to save
8297	Cost of service versus return
8298	price
8299	MIGHT BE MOVEING BUT IF I DO MOVE I WILL KEEP ABCD

8301	The expense involved and the time it takes to get online without difficulties.
8302	Better web rate with their competition
8303	Having problems with being disconnected even after checking all possible problems
8304	selling computer
8305	the membership prices  if ABCD would lower their prices to 9.95 a month then i would definitely stay with them because i love ABCD, it is just too expensive.
8306	Tech support can never fix a problem
8307	cost
8308	high cost of membership
8309	too many pop ups and way too much spam
8310	too expensive for me
8311	may be or may not
8312	We have optimum online and don't use ABCD much
8313	price and service
8314	Keep having problems with ABCD bumping me off-line, program not working correctly and having to restart.  Actually  have to (per ABCD help line) take ABCD off and reload it in my computer.
8315	can  get nother for less money
8316	too expensive
8317	monthly fee too high, other providers less than half the cost
8318	Cost
8319	Because it is to slow
8320	short on funds while unemployed
8321	too much junk mail and too expensive.  I have a mac that does not have os 10 and i hate the ABCD version for mac (that is not for os 10)
8322	I was charged a monthly fee without being notified first.  I had no idea when it would be debited from my account.
8323	Junk E-mail
8324	Slow internet connection, price
8325	too many users not the rigt services for me it seems aimed toward kids
8326	First of all you people make it practically impossible to cancel and I don't like pushy people.  
8327	If my new pricing plan isn't good for the amount of time I use ABCD.
8328	can't afford
8329	I don't spend that much time to pay for the monthly bill.
8330	too much junk mail received. no need for the service anymore, because i use another ISP as well.
8331	Purchased cable modem and ABCD seems like an extra, unnecessary expense.
8332	"I keep getting booted off line.  I get a lot of ""hanging hourglasses""."
8333	cost of service
8334	cost
8335	May get free internet access at work.
8336	to try warpnet.net
8337	gettin access to ABCD, ok from work thru web but not having good luck at home dialing into a modem. When I first got ABCD I didn't seem to have the problems I do now with getting a line to log on
8338	I WOULD CANCEL FOR A PLAN COSTING ME LESS.
8339	Not enough time to use the computer.....Get off work to late and to tired...
8340	I have gotten booted off numerous times, and you're too expensive.
8341	Price
8342	"Other internet access options available; reduce expenses"
8343	i am so very tired of all the junk mail that comes through to my mail box(even though its blocked), also the pop ups are so constant that i can't close them quick enough before the next one pops up!
8344	Cost of plan
8345	Liberal views
8346	customer service dept always gives bad information and false promises
8347	Banner ads and pop up advertisements that require you to delete them are very annoying. I thought paying a high monthly fee would avoid the ads.
8348	bill slashing
8349	two internet services don't justify cost
8350	Less expensive internet providers is available
8351	In addition to frequent problems accessing some of ABCD's features (message boards, my own email), ABCD's service pricing isn't very competitive and too expensive to afford in the current economy.
8352	ABCD seems to be having major errors which limit my use to the internet and other ABCD services.I have been told it is due to the current upgrades, (which unfortunately do not help me since I am using a Mac.) I have lost connection from clients due to ABCD sending notices stating your service has been interrupted. Mail I was sending has been lost due to systems error, I can not upgrade past 2.0 due to use of a mac. If my wife goes into her favorite chat room she is constanly bombarded by spam, and due to the unfortunate lack of not being able to upgrade from 2.0 she cannot block the spam unless she blocks all users on ABCD. For the safety of mt computer system I like to put it on sleep. ABCD has forced us numerous times to shut the computer down in a way that is not approved by MAC do to screen freeze etc.
8353	"When you call for customer service, instead of being able to ""hold"", the recording tells you to ""call back"" and hangs up.  I would prefer the opportunity to hold for customer service help. So much for your commercials of 24/7 help.  Email has been horrible.  There is more Spam now, even though it is advertised as being able to block spam.  I have my Pop-ups set for ""no"" and I get so many pop-ups, it is disgusting."
8354	Too expensive and it alway kick off line or freeze our computer
8355	Usage and cost
8356	too expensive!
8357	Because I am disabled and my husband just had a full knee replaced and he needs another one to.
8358	cost
8359	too many technial problems, and very unprofessional customer  service representives
8360	I GET KICKED OFF FREQUENTLY WITH NO KNOWN REASON.
8361	too expensive
8362	To switch to Cable service
8363	Looking for cheaper options
8364	financial issues
8365	can't get connected to ABCD or stay connected i've called tech support and nothing helps
8366	cant afford
8367	cheaper service
8368	Because of my financial situation.
8369	service is often interrupted
8370	do not like 2.3
8371	Cost per month
8372	Price is to expensive. I found a survice that charges only $9.95 a month that i will be switching to unless ABCD gets cheaper.
8373	Lack of money
8374	can,t afford it
8375	i am currently not financially able at this point and time but hopefully i'll be coming back with you all real soon
8376	Use another cable service.  Can't get rid of trojan horsetied to ABCD.  Too much spam.
8377	the price
8378	I am using cable for my internet connection, and Have been paying for ABCD when other online service is included with my cable connection.  I had paid ABCD  year ahead, which has now expired.  I have accepted ABCD's offer to try the 9.95 monthly plan for free,and will re-evaluate when the free offer has expired.
8379	Sorry,I did not mean to say I would cancel. Should have been that I would not cancel. Would change it, but there is not a back button.
8380	too expensive
8381	DONT HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT
8382	"I feel that the customer service reps are very rude. As a result, I don't feel comfortable contacting your company. If, for one reason or another, I have another problem, with let's say, getting reset by a remote host, I would rather cancel my service entirely then have to wait on hold for endless amounts of time only to be ""helped""  by a rude person who seems more interested in being a jerk and trying to get off the phone than to help me out."
8383	The way that some others are offering dial up for $9.95. You folks charge over $25.00 for the same service.
8384	Too many problems with services, poor cusomer service. Too many problems with products.
8385	I am paying right now 28.90 per month and other companies have better offers.
8386	it would depend upon the pricing structure--I know of at least one source where I can get unlimited access for $9.95 per month
8387	Not sure if able to keep paying for the services.
8388	Continuous problems. Everytime i compact my filing cabinet, i have to reinstall ABCD because it wont load the next time i go to use it. And getting phone techs to help is a joke.. had 3 different ones tell me my brand new laptop needed to be service because i need more memory. Finally i went to live help and that rep said i didnt need more memory, which i already knew, but the suggestions he made didnt help my problem either.
8389	I keep getting booted off line
8390	"Too much spam; too many pop ups; expense; invasiveness"
8391	Cost is higher than pretty much all other providers and have had to deal with some VERY rude customer service people. Also had to deal with being charged for a service that I never finished registering for and go through the hassle of stopping it and having to wait for my bank account to be credited
8392	i have a hard time signing on, most of the time my computer locks up.
8393	because of the price they charge
8394	It is not my main ISP and I don't use it enough in order to pay for it.
8395	cost of service is high
8396	Not enough minutes
8397	money reasons
8398	Getting disconnected frequently, slow WWW response, tech support people who didn't solve my problem, too expensive for just sending files back and forth (which is what I mostly do).
8399	Too expensive and too slow
8400	because   we lost world play website
8401	In Version 2.3, ABCD seems to cause conflicts with my other programs. Once it was removed, everything worked fine. If I cannot go forward without messing up my other programs than I will not keep it. I hate being at a standstill.
8402	The hold time for customer service is very long. There are several internet services that are cheaper.
8403	Because of the poor service, the pop-ups are constant and the pop-up controls do not work, we have been customers for over 5 years and have really gotten no satisfaction or credit up until recently. Free service would be greatly appreciated
8404	monthly fee too high in comparison to other services which are getting better.
8405	KEEP HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING KICKED OFF WAITING WAITING & WAITING
8406	Disconnections
8407	ineptness of technical service
8408	high price of service
8409	Cost of monthly fees
8410	Annoying pop ups everytime I log on and off.  Price is too high.
8411	finacial reasons
8412	I was overcharged on my account.  I was charged twice.  I also ended up having to pay an over the limit charge on my credit card due to ABCD's mistake.
8413	Price
8414	ABCD has some problems with customer service. I have contacted them 2 different times and asked them to send me a bill for my service and they have yet to!!
8415	Getting disconnected
8416	i dont us the internet very much while im not in school this summer and am on vacation
8417	NOt enough chat rooms, only hold 30 something very hard to get into interest group, thrown off line without reason, call get no responce except it must be your computer, call  whom ever you bought it from. Lack of monotors in rooms, see children in adult room. Gay bashing in rooms
8418	I can recieve unlimited use for lower monthly fees
8419	I have used ABCD for many years mainly because it was the only one in its league for so long.  These days however, they're are many to choose from for much less money that pretty much do the same, aside from Instant Messaging, which even some have that now.
8420	takes so long to get through on ABCD
8421	Customer service
8422	I keep being disconnected. much more since I installed 2.3
8423	BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SPAM I RECEIVE IN MY MAIL DAILEY. I REPORT IT IN THE HOPE THAT YOU CAN CATCH THRSE MORONS THAT HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT BUG US. IT IS FRUSTRATING TO GET 20 OR MORE SPAM MAIL EVERY TIME I OPEN MMY MAIL
8424	THE BETA TESTER POPUP ON SIGNING ON IS HORRIBLE AND.....  THE COST IS GETTING TOO MUCH
8425	I get knocked off line or ABCD locks up and I have to turn off pc manually. This happens frequently.
8426	too expensive, and i don't use any of the services other than e-mail

8428	The monthly subscription is more than other company offers.
8429	price
8430	price, performance, connection trouble
8431	The cost of membership.
8432	The expense,money is tight, I am seeing advertisments for cheaper unlimited internet service
8433	Other providers have cheaper service, such as 9.95 a month for dial up or 10 hrs a month free.
8434	possible money issues
8435	cost
8436	none of our friend use ABCD. They don't like it
8437	always getting booted
8438	ABCD gives your credit card information, to other places sometimes, especially privacy plus, without you agreeing to it, i dont like that
8439	It takes too long to get online and there have been times while answering an e-mail or researching something I fall off line and have to start all over again. It has taken up to one hour to get online and I am tired of it.
8440	Another ISP
8441	Price is higher than ANY other provider.  Customer Service is great, but it takes SO long to get to talk to someone.
8442	not being able to log on...ended sessions...certain conections very slow speed...get a cheaper faster conection...windows problems caused by ABCD...pop up ads from ABCD before I can get my mail...I have used XXVD and outlook and I like that set up better...too many tool bars, can't maximize viewing of larger sites or photos (like you can with msexplorer).  y'all spend to much time and money trying to get new subscribers and don't try to hang on the ones you have.  I have tried to get help for these problems to no avail.
8443	Getting kicked off to often.

8462	Can not get high speed access thru ABCD
8463	i keep getting kicked off line i haven't been hppy about the billing
8464	simply because it is not a necessity...  if we had to cut back on expenses -  then we would cancel ABCD
